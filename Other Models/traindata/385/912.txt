     maecenas, born of monarch ancestors,
       the shield at once and glory of my life!
       there are who joy them in the olympic strife
     and love the dust they gather in the course;
     the goal by hot wheels shunn'd, the famous prize,
       exalt them to the gods that rule mankind;
       this joys, if rabbles fickle as the wind
     through triple grade of honours bid him rise,
     that, if his granary has stored away
       of libya's thousand floors the yield entire;
       the man who digs his field as did his sire,
     with honest pride, no attalus may sway
     by proffer'd wealth to tempt myrtoan seas,
       the timorous captain of a cyprian bark.
       the winds that make icarian billows dark
     the merchant fears, and hugs the rural ease
     of his own village home; but soon, ashamed
       of penury, he refits his batter'd craft.
       there is, who thinks no scorn of massic draught,
     who robs the daylight of an hour unblamed,
     now stretch'd beneath the arbute on the sward,
       now by some gentle river's sacred spring;
       some love the camp, the clarion's joyous ring,
     and battle, by the mother's soul abhorr'd.
     see, patient waiting in the clear keen air,
       the hunter, thoughtless of his delicate bride,
       whether the trusty hounds a stag have eyed,
     or the fierce marsian boar has burst the snare.
     to me the artist's meed, the ivy wreath
       is very heaven: me the sweet cool of woods,
       where satyrs frolic with the nymphs, secludes
     from rabble rout, so but euterpe's breath
     fail not the flute, nor polyhymnia fly
       averse from stringing new the lesbian lyre.
       o, write my name among that minstrel choir,
     and my proud head shall strike upon the sky!

     enough of snow and hail at last
       the sire has sent in vengeance down:
     his bolts, at his own temple cast,
         appall'd the town,
     appall'd the lands, lest pyrrha's time
       return, with all its monstrous sights,
     when proteus led his flocks to climb
               the flatten'd heights,
     when fish were in the elm-tops caught,
       where once the stock-dove wont to bide,
     and does were floating, all distraught,
               adown the tide.
     old tiber, hurl'd in tumult back
       from mingling with the etruscan main,
     has threaten'd numa's court with wrack
               and vesta's fane.
     roused by his ilia's plaintive woes,
       he vows revenge for guiltless blood,
     and, spite of jove, his banks o'erflows,
               uxorious flood.
     yes, fame shall tell of civic steel
       that better persian lives had spilt,
     to youths, whose minish'd numbers feel
               their parents' guilt.
     what god shall rome invoke to stay
       her fall? can suppliance overbear
     the ear of vesta, turn'd away
               from chant and prayer?
     who comes, commission'd to atone
       for crime like ours? at length appear,
     a cloud round thy bright shoulders thrown,
               apollo seer!
     or venus, laughter-loving dame,
       round whom gay loves and pleasures fly;
     or thou, if slighted sons may claim
               a parent's eye,
     o weary--with thy long, long game,
       who lov'st fierce shouts and helmets bright,
     and moorish warrior's glance of flame
               or e'er he smite!
     or maia's son, if now awhile
       in youthful guise we see thee here,
     caesar's avenger--such the style
               thou deign'st to bear;
     late be thy journey home, and long
       thy sojourn with rome's family;
     nor let thy wrath at our great wrong
               lend wings to fly.
     here take our homage, chief and sire;
       here wreathe with bay thy conquering brow,
     and bid the prancing mede retire,
               our caesar thou!

        thus may cyprus' heavenly queen,
     thus helen's brethren, stars of brightest sheen,
       guide thee! may the sire of wind
     each truant gale, save only zephyr, bind!
       so do thou, fair ship, that ow'st
     virgil, thy precious freight, to attic coast,
       safe restore thy loan and whole,
     and save from death the partner of my soul!
       oak and brass of triple fold
     encompass'd sure that heart, which first made bold
       to the raging sea to trust
     a fragile bark, nor fear'd the afric gust
       with its northern mates at strife,
     nor hyads' frown, nor south-wind fury-rife,
       mightiest power that hadria knows,
     wills he the waves to madden or compose.
       what had death in store to awe
     those eyes, that huge sea-beasts unmelting saw,
       saw the swelling of the surge,
     and high ceraunian cliffs, the seaman's scourge?
       heaven's high providence in vain
     has sever'd countries with the estranging main,
       if our vessels ne'ertheless
     with reckless plunge that sacred bar transgress.
       daring all, their goal to win,
     men tread forbidden ground, and rush on sin:
       daring all, prometheus play'd
     his wily game, and fire to man convey'd;
       soon as fire was stolen away,
     pale fever's stranger host and wan decay
       swept o'er earth's polluted face,
     and slow fate quicken'd death's once halting pace.
       daedalus the void air tried
     on wings, to humankind by heaven denied;
       acheron's bar gave way with ease
     before the arm of labouring hercules.
       nought is there for man too high;
     our impious folly e'en would climb the sky,
       braves the dweller on the steep,
     nor lets the bolts of heavenly vengeance sleep.

     the touch of zephyr and of spring has loosen'd winter's thrall;
       the well-dried keels are wheel'd again to sea:
     the ploughman cares not for his fire, nor cattle for their stall,
       and frost no more is whitening all the lea.
     now cytherea leads the dance, the bright moon overhead;
       the graces and the nymphs, together knit,
     with rhythmic feet the meadow beat, while vulcan, fiery red,
       heats the cyclopian forge in aetna's pit.
     'tis now the time to wreathe the brow with branch of myrtle green,
       or flowers, just opening to the vernal breeze;
     now faunus claims his sacrifice among the shady treen,
       lambkin or kidling, which soe'er he please.
     pale death, impartial, walks his round; he knocks at cottage-gate
       and palace-portal. sestius, child of bliss!
     how should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?
         lo here! the fabulous ghosts, the dark abyss,
     the void of the plutonian hall, where soon as e'er you go,
         no more for you shall leap the auspicious die
     to seat you on the throne of wine; no more your breast shall glow
       for lycidas, the star of every eye.

     what slender youth, besprinkled with perfume,
         courts you on roses in some grotto's shade?
       fair pyrrha, say, for whom
         your yellow hair you braid,
     so trim, so simple! ah! how oft shall he
       lament that faith can fail, that gods can change,
         viewing the rough black sea
           with eyes to tempests strange,
     who now is basking in your golden smile,
       and dreams of you still fancy-free, still kind,
         poor fool, nor knows the guile
           of the deceitful wind!
     woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud
       untried! for me, they show in yonder fane
         my dripping garments, vow'd
           to him who curbs the main.

     not i, but varius:--he, of homer's brood
       a tuneful swan, shall bear you on his wing,
     your tale of trophies, won by field or flood,
         mighty alike to sing.
     not mine such themes, agrippa; no, nor mine
       to chant the wrath that fill'd pelides' breast,
     nor dark ulysses' wanderings o'er the brine,
         nor pelops' house unblest.
     vast were the task, i feeble; inborn shame,
       and she, who makes the peaceful lyre submit,
     forbid me to impair great caesar's fame
         and yours by my weak wit.
     but who may fitly sing of mars array'd
       in adamant mail, or merion, black with dust
     of troy, or tydeus' son by pallas' aid
         strong against gods to thrust?
     feasts are my theme, my warriors maidens fair,
       who with pared nails encounter youths in fight;
     be fancy free or caught in cupid's snare,
         her temper still is light.

     let others rhodes or mytilene sing,
         or ephesus, or corinth, set between
     two seas, or thebes, or delphi, for its king
         each famous, or thessalian tempe green;
     there are who make chaste pallas' virgin tower
         the daily burden of unending song,
     and search for wreaths the olive's rifled bower;
         the praise of juno sounds from many a tongue,
     telling of argos' steeds, mycenaes's gold.
         for me stern sparta forges no such spell,
     no, nor larissa's plain of richest mould,
         as bright albunea echoing from her cell.
     o headlong anio! o tiburnian groves,
         and orchards saturate with shifting streams!
     look how the clear fresh south from heaven removes
         the tempest, nor with rain perpetual teems!
     you too be wise, my plancus: life's worst cloud
         will melt in air, by mellow wine allay'd,
     dwell you in camps, with glittering banners proud,
         or 'neath your tibur's canopy of shade.
     when teucer fled before his father's frown
         from salamis, they say his temples deep
     he dipp'd in wine, then wreath'd with poplar crown,
         and bade his comrades lay their grief to sleep:
     "where fortune bears us, than my sire more kind,
         there let us go, my own, my gallant crew.
     'tis teucer leads, 'tis teucer breathes the wind;
         no more despair; apollo's word is true.
     another salamis in kindlier air
         shall yet arise. hearts, that have borne with me
     worse buffets! drown to-day in wine your care;
         to-morrow we recross the wide, wide sea!"

         lydia, by all above,
     why bear so hard on sybaris, to ruin him with love?
         what change has made him shun
     the playing-ground, who once so well could bear the dust and sun?
         why does he never sit
     on horseback in his company, nor with uneven bit
         his gallic courser tame?
     why dreads he yellow tiber, as 'twould sully that fair frame?
         like poison loathes the oil,
     his arms no longer black and blue with honourable toil,
         he who erewhile was known
     for quoit or javelin oft and oft beyond the limit thrown?
         why skulks he, as they say
     did thetis' son before the dawn of ilion's fatal day,
         for fear the manly dress
     should fling him into danger's arms, amid the lycian press?

     see, how it stands, one pile of snow,
       soracte! 'neath the pressure yield
     its groaning woods; the torrents' flow
       with clear sharp ice is all congeal'd.
     heap high the logs, and melt the cold,
       good thaliarch; draw the wine we ask,
     that mellower vintage, four-year-old,
       from out the cellar'd sabine cask.
     the future trust with jove; when he
       has still'd the warring tempests' roar
     on the vex'd deep, the cypress-tree
       and aged ash are rock'd no more.
     o, ask not what the morn will bring,
       but count as gain each day that chance
     may give you; sport in life's young spring,
       nor scorn sweet love, nor merry dance,
     while years are green, while sullen eld
       is distant. now the walk, the game,
     the whisper'd talk at sunset held,
       each in its hour, prefer their claim.
     sweet too the laugh, whose feign'd alarm
       the hiding-place of beauty tells,
     the token, ravish'd from the arm
       or finger, that but ill rebels.

     grandson of atlas, wise of tongue,

     man's savage youth by power of song
             and plastic game!
     thee sing i, herald of the sky,
       who gav'st the lyre its music sweet,
     hiding whate'er might please thine eye
             in frolic cheat.
     see, threatening thee, poor guileless child,
       apollo claims, in angry tone,
     his cattle;--all at once he smiled,
             his quiver gone.
     strong in thy guidance, hector's sire
       escaped the atridae, pass'd between
     thessalian tents and warders' fire,
             of all unseen.
     thou lay'st unspotted souls to rest;
      thy golden rod pale spectres know;
     blest power! by all thy brethren blest,

   better far to bear the future, my leuconoe, like the past,
   whether jove has many winters yet to give, or this our last;
   this, that makes the tyrrhene billows spend their strength against
        the shore.
   strain your wine and prove your wisdom; life is short; should hope

   in the moment of our talking, envious time has ebb'd away.
   seize the present; trust to-morrow e'en as little as you may.

     what man, what hero, clio sweet,
       on harp or flute wilt thou proclaim?
     what god shall echo's voice repeat
       in mocking game
     to helicon's sequester'd shade,
       or pindus, or on haemus chill,
     where once the hurrying woods obey'd
       the minstrel's will,
     who, by his mother's gift of song,
       held the fleet stream, the rapid breeze,
     and led with blandishment along
       the listening trees?
     whom praise we first? the sire on high,
       who gods and men unerring guides,
     who rules the sea, the earth, the sky,
       their times and tides.
     no mightier birth may he beget;
       no like, no second has he known;
     yet nearest to her sire's is set
       minerva's throne.
     nor yet shall bacchus pass unsaid,
       bold warrior, nor the virgin foe
     of savage beasts, nor phoebus, dread

     alcides too shall be my theme,
       and leda's twins, for horses be,

       their stars at sea,
     the lash'd spray trickles from the steep,
       the wind sinks down, the storm-cloud flies,
     the threatening billow on the deep
       obedient lies.
     shall now quirinus take his turn,
       or quiet numa, or the state
     proud tarquin held, or cato stern,
       by death made great?
     ay, regulus and the scaurian name,
       and paullus, who at cannae gave
     his glorious soul, fair record claim,
       for all were brave.
     thee, furius, and fabricius, thee,
       rough curius too, with untrimm'd beard,
     your sires' transmitted poverty
        to conquest rear'd.
     marcellus' fame, its up-growth hid,
       springs like a tree; great julius' light
     shines, like the radiant moon amid
       the lamps of night.
     dread sire and guardian of man's race,
       to thee, o jove, the fates assign
     our caesar's charge; his power and place
       be next to thine.
     whether the parthian, threatening rome,
       his eagles scatter to the wind,
     or follow to their eastern home
       cathay and ind,

       thy car shall shake the realms above;
     thy vengeful bolts shall overthrow

       to his prime clay some favourite part
     from every kind, took lion mad,
       and lodged its gall in man's poor heart.
     'twas wrath that laid thyestes low;
       'tis wrath that oft destruction calls
     on cities, and invites the foe
       to drive his plough o'er ruin'd walls.
     then calm your spirit; i can tell
       how once, when youth in all my veins
     was glowing, blind with rage, i fell
       on friend and foe in ribald strains.
     come, let me change my sour for sweet,
       and smile complacent as before:
     hear me my palinode repeat,
       and give me back your heart once more.

   silence thou thy savage cymbals, and the berecyntine horn;
       in their train self-love still follows, dully, desperately

     amid her ruin'd halls she stood

       you thrill our ears; the clarion brays;
     the lightnings of the armour scare
       the steed, and daunt the rider's gaze.

       with no uncomely dust distain'd,
     and all the world by conquest bow'd,
       and only cato's soul unchain'd.
     yes, juno and the powers on high
       that left their afric to its doom,
     have led the victors' progeny
       as victims to jugurtha's tomb.
     what field, by latian blood-drops fed,
       proclaims not the unnatural deeds
     it buries, and the earthquake dread
       whose distant thunder shook the medes?
     what gulf, what river has not seen
       those sights of sorrow? nay, what sea
     has daunian carnage yet left green?
       what coast from roman blood is free?
     but pause, gay muse, nor leave your play
       another cean dirge to sing;

     honour to proculeius! he

       more power than if his broad-based throne
     bridged libya's sea, and either coast
           were all his own.
     indulgence bids the dropsy grow;
       who fain would quench the palate's flame

     phraates, throned where cyrus sate,

     she weans men's lips; for him she keeps

       o dellius, dellius! sure to die,
     whether in gloom you spend each year,
       or through long holydays at ease
     in grassy nook your spirit cheer
       with old falernian vintages,
     where poplar pale, and pine-tree high
       their hospitable shadows spread
     entwined, and panting waters try
       to hurry down their zigzag bed.
     bring wine and scents, and roses' bloom,
       too brief, alas! to that sweet place,
     while life, and fortune, and the loom
       of the three sisters yield you grace.
     soon must you leave the woods you buy,
       your villa, wash'd by tiber's flow,
     leave,--and your treasures, heap'd so high,
       your reckless heir will level low.
     whether from argos' founder born
       in wealth you lived beneath the sun,
     or nursed in beggary and scorn,
       you fall to death, who pities none.
     one way all travel; the dark urn
       shakes each man's lot, that soon or late
     will force him, hopeless of return,
       on board the exile-ship of fate.

     tecmessa's charms enslaved her lord,
       stout ajax, heir of telamon;
     atrides, in his pride, adored
           the maid he won,
     when troy to thessaly gave way,
       and hector's all too quick decease
     made pergamus an easier prey
           to wearied greece.
     what if, as auburn phyllis' mate,
       you graft yourself on regal stem?
     oh yes! be sure her sires were great;
           she weeps for them.
     believe me, from no rascal scum
       your charmer sprang; so true a flame,
     such hate of greed, could never come
           from vulgar dame.
     with honest fervour i commend

     fair tibur, town of argive kings,

     at rest from seas and travellings,

     should angry fate those wishes foil,
       then let me seek galesus, sweet
     to skin-clad sheep, and that rich soil,
           the spartan's seat.
     o, what can match the green recess,
       whose honey not to hybla yields,
     whose olives vie with those that bless
           venafrum's fields?
     long springs, mild winters glad that spot
       by jove's good grace, and aulon, dear
     to fruitful bacchus, envies not
           falernian cheer.
     that spot, those happy heights desire

       and your own gods, a man of peace,
     pompey, the earliest friend i knew,
       with whom i oft cut short the hours
     with wine, my hair bright bathed in dew
       of syrian oils, and wreathed with flowers?
     with you i shared philippi's rout,
       unseemly parted from my shield,
     when valour fell, and warriors stout
       were tumbled on the inglorious field:
     but i was saved by mercury,
       wrapp'd in thick mist, yet trembling sore,
     while you to that tempestuous sea
       were swept by battle's tide once more.
     come, pay to jove the feast you owe;
       lay down those limbs, with warfare spent,
     beneath my laurel; nor be slow
       to drain my cask; for you 'twas meant.
     lethe's true draught is massic wine;
       fill high the goblet; pour out free
     rich streams of unguent. who will twine
       the hasty wreath from myrtle-tree
     or parsley? whom will venus seat
       chairman of cups? are bacchants sane?

     the rain, it rains not every day
       on the soak'd meads; the caspian main
     not always feels the unequal sway
       of storms, nor on armenia's plain,
     dear valgius, lies the cold dull snow
       through all the year; nor northwinds keen
     upon garganian oakwoods blow,

     you still with tearful tones pursue
       your lost, lost mystes; hesper sees

     yet not for loved antilochus
       grey nestor wasted all his years

     licinius, trust a seaman's lore:

     nor, fearing storms, by treacherous shore
         too closely creep.
     who makes the golden mean his guide,
       shuns miser's cabin, foul and dark,
     shuns gilded roofs, where pomp and pride
           are envy's mark.
     with fiercer blasts the pine's dim height
       is rock'd; proud towers with heavier fall
     crash to the ground; and thunders smite
           the mountains tall.
     in sadness hope, in gladness fear
       'gainst coming change will fortify
     your breast. the storms that jupiter
           sweeps o'er the sky
     he chases. why should rain to-day
       bring rain to-morrow? python's foe
     is pleased sometimes his lyre to play,
           nor bends his bow.
     be brave in trouble; meet distress

     too prosperous blows, be wise no less,

     disjoin'd from us by hadria's bar,
       nor puzzle, quintius, how to spend
     a life so simple. youth removes,
       and beauty too; and hoar decay
     drives out the wanton tribe of loves
       and sleep, that came or night or day.
     the sweet spring-flowers not always keep
       their bloom, nor moonlight shines the same
     each evening. why with thoughts too deep
       o'ertask a mind of mortal frame?
     why not, just thrown at careless ease
       'neath plane or pine, our locks of grey
     perfumed with syrian essences
       and wreathed with roses, while we may,
     lie drinking? bacchus puts to shame
       the cares that waste us. where's the slave
     to quench the fierce falernian's flame
       with water from the passing wave?
     who'll coax coy lyde from her home?
       go, bid her take her ivory lyre,

     the earth-born youth, whose terrors dimm'd the shine

     how nought she does but lends her added grace,
       whether she dance, or join in bantering play,
     or with soft arms the maiden choir embrace
           on great diana's day.
     say, would you change for all the wealth possest
       by rich achaemenes or phrygia's heir,
     or the full stores of araby the blest,
           one lock of her dear hair,
     while to your burning lips she bends her neck,
       or with kind cruelty denies the due
     she means you not to beg for, but to take,
           or snatches it from you?

     his father's throat the monster press'd

     i ween, the blood of midnight guest;
       black colchian drugs, whate'er of guilt

       who planted in my rural stead
     thee, fatal wood, thee, sure to fall
       upon thy blameless master's head.
     the dangers of the hour! no thought
       we give them; punic seaman's fear
     is all of bosporus, nor aught
       recks he of pitfalls otherwhere;
     the soldier fears the mask'd retreat
       of parthia; parthia dreads the thrall

     the blest seclusion of the good,
       and sappho, with sweet lyric moan
     bewailing her ungentle sex,

     chanting thy tale of woful wrecks,
       of woful exile, woful war!
     in sacred awe the silent dead
       attend on each: but when the song
     of combat tells and tyrants fled,
       keen ears, press'd shoulders, closer throng.
     what marvel, when at those sweet airs
       the hundred-headed beast spell-bound
     each black ear droops, and furies' hairs
       uncoil their serpents at the sound?
     prometheus too and pelops' sire

     your land, your house, your lovely bride
       must lose you; of your cherish'd trees
     none to its fleeting master's side

     your heir, a larger soul, will drain

     your avarice tramples; see, the outcasts fly,
         wife and husband, in their arms
     their fathers' gods, their squalid family.
         yet no hall that wealth e'er plann'd
     waits you more surely than the wider room
         traced by death's yet greedier hand.
     why strain so far? you cannot leap the tomb.
         earth removes the impartial sod
     alike for beggar and for monarch's child:
         nor the slave of hell's dark god
     convey'd prometheus back, with bribe beguiled.
         pelops he and pelops' sire
     holds, spite of pride, in close captivity;
         beggars, who of labour tire,
     call'd or uncall'd, he hears and sets them free.

     bacchus i saw in mountain glades
       retired (believe it, after years!)
     teaching his strains to dryad maids,
       while goat-hoof'd satyrs prick'd their ears.
     evoe! my eyes with terror glare;
       my heart is revelling with the god;
     'tis madness! evoe! spare, o spare,
       dread wielder of the ivied rod!
     yes, i may sing the thyiad crew,
       the stream of wine, the sparkling rills
     that run with milk, and honey-dew
       that from the hollow trunk distils;
     and i may sing thy consort's crown,
       new set in heaven, and pentheus' hall
     with ruthless ruin thundering down,
       and proud lycurgus' funeral.
     thou turn'st the rivers, thou the sea;
       thou, on far summits, moist with wine,
     thy bacchants' tresses harmlessly
       dost knot with living serpent-twine.
     thou, when the giants, threatening wrack,
       were clambering up jove's citadel,
     didst hurl o'erweening rhoetus back,
       in tooth and claw a lion fell.
     who knew thy feats in dance and play
       deem'd thee belike for war's rough game
     unmeet: but peace and battle-fray
       found thee, their centre, still the same.
     grim cerberus wagg'd his tail to see
       thy golden horn, nor dream'd of wrong,
     but gently fawning, follow'd thee,
       and lick'd thy feet with triple tongue.

     a two-form'd bard, no more to bide
       within the range of envy's eye
     'mid haunts of men. i, all ungraced
       by gentle blood, i, whom you call
     your friend, maecenas, shall not taste
       of death, nor chafe in lethe's thrall.
     e'en now a rougher skin expands
       along my legs: above i change
     to a white bird; and o'er my hands
       and shoulders grows a plumage strange:
     fleeter than icarus, see me float
       o'er bosporus, singing as i go,
     and o'er gastulian sands remote,

       my warbling, and the banks of rhone.
     no dirges for my fancied death;

     all clamorous grief were waste of breath,
       and vain the tribute of o grave.

     i bid the unhallow'd crowd avaunt!
       keep holy silence; strains unknown
     till now, the muses' hierophant,
       i sing to youths and maids alone.
     kings o'er their flocks the sceptre wield;
       e'en kings beneath jove's sceptre bow:
     victor in giant battle-field,
       he moves all nature with his brow.
     this man his planted walks extends
       beyond his peers; an older name
     one to the people's choice commends;
       one boasts a more unsullied fame;
     one plumes him on a larger crowd
       of clients. what are great or small?
     death takes the mean man with the proud;
       the fatal urn has room for all.
     when guilty pomp the drawn sword sees
       hung o'er her, richest feasts in vain
     strain their sweet juice her taste to please;
       no lutes, no singing birds again
     will bring her sleep. sleep knows no pride;
       it scorns not cots of village hinds,
     nor shadow-trembling river-side,
       nor tempe, stirr'd by western winds.
     who, having competence, has all,
       the tumult of the sea defies,
     nor fears arcturus' angry fall,
       nor fears the kid-star's sullen rise,
     though hail-storms on the vineyard beat,
       though crops deceive, though trees complain.
     one while of showers, one while of heat,
       one while of winter's barbarous reign.
     fish feel the narrowing of the main
       from sunken piles, while on the strand
     contractors with their busy train
       let down huge stones, and lords of land
     affect the sea: but fierce alarm
       can clamber to the master's side:
     black cares can up the galley swarm,
       and close behind the horseman ride.
     if phrygian marbles soothe not pain,
       nor star-bright purple's costliest wear,
     nor vines of true falernian strain,
       nor achaemenian spices rare,
     why with rich gate and pillar'd range
       upbuild new mansions, twice as high,
     or why my sabine vale exchange
       for more laborious luxury?

     to suffer hardness with good cheer,
       in sternest school of warfare bred,
     our youth should learn; let steed and spear
       make him one day the parthian's dread;
     cold skies, keen perils, brace his life.
       methinks i see from rampined town
     some battling tyrant's matron wife,
       some maiden, look in terror down,--
     "ah, my dear lord, untrain'd in war!
       o tempt not the infuriate mood
     of that fell lion! see! from far
       he plunges through a tide of blood!"
     what joy, for fatherland to die!
       death's darts e'en flying feet o'ertake,
     nor spare a recreant chivalry,
       a back that cowers, or loins that quake.
     true virtue never knows defeat:
       her robes she keeps unsullied still,
     nor takes, nor quits, her curule seat
       to please a people's veering will.
     true virtue opens heaven to worth:
       she makes the way she does not find:
     the vulgar crowd, the humid earth,
       her soaring pinion leaves behind.
     seal'd lips have blessings sure to come:
       who drags eleusis' rite to day,
     that man shall never share my home,
       or join my voyage: roofs give way
     and boats are wreck'd: true men and thieves
       neglected justice oft confounds:
     though vengeance halt, she seldom leaves
       the wretch whose flying steps she hounds.

     the man of firm and righteous will,
       no rabble, clamorous for the wrong,
     no tyrant's brow, whose frown may kill,
       can shake the strength that makes him strong:
     not winds, that chafe the sea they sway,
       nor jove's right hand, with lightning red:
     should nature's pillar'd frame give way,
       that wreck would strike one fearless head.
     pollux and roving hercules
       thus won their way to heaven's proud steep,
     'mid whom augustus, couch'd at ease,
       dyes his red lips with nectar deep.
     for this, great bacchus, tigers drew
       thy glorious car, untaught to slave
     in harness: thus quirinus flew
       on mars' wing'd steeds from acheron's wave,
     when juno spoke with heaven's assent:
       "o ilium, ilium, wretched town!
     the judge accurst, incontinent,
       and stranger dame have dragg'd thee down.
     pallas and i, since priam's sire
       denied the gods his pledged reward,
     had doom'd them all to sword and fire,
       the people and their perjured lord.
     no more the adulterous guest can charm
       the spartan queen: the house forsworn
     no more repels by hector's arm
       my warriors, baffled and outworn:
     hush'd is the war our strife made long:
       i welcome now, my hatred o'er,
     a grandson in the child of wrong,
       him whom the trojan priestess bore.
     receive him, mars! the gates of flame
       may open: let him taste forgiven
     the nectar, and enrol his name
       among the peaceful ranks of heaven.
     let the wide waters sever still
       ilium and rome, the exiled race
     may reign and prosper where they will:
       so but in paris' burial-place
     the cattle sport, the wild beasts hide
       their cubs, the capitol may stand
     all bright, and rome in warlike pride
       o'er media stretch a conqueror's hand.
     aye, let her scatter far and wide
       her terror, where the land-lock'd waves
     europe from afric's shore divide,
       where swelling nile the corn-field laves--
     of strength more potent to disdain
       hid gold, best buried in the mine,
     than gather it with hand profane,
       that for man's greed would rob a shrine.
     whate'er the bound to earth ordain'd,
       there let her reach the arm of power,
     travelling, where raves the fire unrein'd,
       and where the storm-cloud and the shower.
     yet, warlike roman, know thy doom,
       nor, drunken with a conqueror's joy,
     or blind with duteous zeal, presume
       to build again ancestral troy.
     should troy revive to hateful life,
       her star again should set in gore,
     while i, jove's sister and his wife,
       to victory led my host once more.
     though phoebus thrice in brazen mail
       should case her towers, they thrice should fall,
     storm'd by my greeks: thrice wives should wail
       husband and son, themselves in thrall."
     --such thunders from the lyre of love!
       back, wayward muse! refrain, refrain
     to tell the talk of gods above,
       and dwarf high themes in puny strain.

     me, as i lay on vultur's steep,
       a truant past apulia's bound,
     o'ertired, poor child, with play and sleep,
       with living green the stock-doves crown'd--
     a legend, nay, a miracle,
       by acherontia's nestlings told,
     by all in bantine glade that dwell,
       or till the rich forentan mould.
     "bears, vipers, spared him as he lay,
       the sacred garland deck'd his hair,
     the myrtle blended with the bay:
       the child's inspired: the gods were there."
     your grace, sweet muses, shields me still
       on sabine heights, or lets me range
     where cool praeneste, tibur's hill,
       or liquid baiae proffers change.
     me to your springs, your dances true,
       philippi bore not to the ground,
     nor the doom'd tree in falling slew,
       nor billowy palinurus drown'd.
     grant me your presence, blithe and fain
       mad bosporus shall my bark explore;
     my foot shall tread the sandy plain
       that glows beside assyria's shore;
     'mid briton tribes, the stranger's foe,
       and spaniards, drunk with horses' blood,
     and quiver'd scythians, will i go
       unharm'd, and look on tanais' flood.
     when caesar's self in peaceful town
       the weary veteran's home has made,
     you bid him lay his helmet down
       and rest in your pierian shade.
     mild thoughts you plant, and joy to see
       mild thoughts take root. the nations know
     how with descending thunder he
       the impious titans hurl'd below,
     who rules dull earth and stormy seas,
       and towns of men, and realms of pain,
     and gods, and mortal companies,
       alone, impartial in his reign.
     yet jove had fear'd the giant rush,
       their upraised arms, their port of pride,
     and the twin brethren bent to push
       huge pelion up olympus' side.
     but typhon, mimas, what could these,
       or what porphyrion's stalwart scorn,
     rhoetus, or he whose spears were trees,
       enceladus, from earth uptorn,
     as on they rush'd in mad career
       'gainst pallas' shield? here met the foe
     fierce vulcan, queenly juno here,
       and he who ne'er shall quit his bow,
     who laves in clear castalian flood
       his locks, and loves the leafy growth
     of lycia next his native wood,
       the delian and the pataran both.
     strength, mindless, falls by its own weight;
       strength, mix'd with mind, is made more strong
     by the just gods, who surely hate
       the strength whose thoughts are set on wrong.
     let hundred-handed gyas bear
       his witness, and orion known
     tempter of dian, chaste and fair,
       by dian's maiden dart o'erthrown.
     hurl'd on the monstrous shapes she bred,
       earth groans, and mourns her children thrust
     to orcus; aetna's weight of lead
       keeps down the fire that breaks its crust;
     still sits the bird on tityos' breast,
       the warder of unlawful love;

     break but her meshes, will the deer
       assail you? then will he be brave
     who once to faithless foes has knelt;
       yes, carthage yet his spear will fly,
     who with bound arms the cord has felt,
       the coward, and has fear'd to die.
     he knows not, he, how life is won;
       thinks war, like peace, a thing of trade!
     great art thou, carthage! mate the sun,
       while italy in dust is laid!"
     his wife's pure kiss he waved aside,
       and prattling boys, as one disgraced,
     they tell us, and with manly pride
       stern on the ground his visage placed.
     with counsel thus ne'er else aread
       he nerved the fathers' weak intent,
     and, girt by friends that mourn'd him, sped
       into illustrious banishment.
     well witting what the torturer's art
       design'd him, with like unconcern
     the press of kin he push'd apart
       and crowds encumbering his return,
     as though, some tedious business o'er

     theirs was a hardy soldier-brood,

     when sunset lengthen'd from each height
       the shadows, and unyoked the steer,

     one only, true to hymen's flame,

     that splendid falsehood lights her name

     "wake!" to her youthful spouse she cried,
       "wake! or you yet may sleep too well:

           all afric's golden sheaves.
     though no calabrian bees their honey yield
       for me, nor mellowing sleeps the god of wine
     in formian jar, nor in gaul's pasture-field
           the wool grows long and fine,
     yet poverty ne'er comes to break my peace;
       if more i craved, you would not more refuse.
     desiring less, i better shall increase

       weaving a crown the nymphs to please:
     that gloomy night she look'd on nought
            but stars and seas.
     then, as in hundred-citied crete
       she landed,--"o my sire!" she said,
     "o childly duty! passion's heat
            has struck thee dead.
     whence came i? death, for maiden's shame,
       were little. do i wake to weep
     my sin? or am i pure of blame,
            and is it sleep
     from dreamland brings a form to trick
       my senses? which was best? to go
     over the long, long waves, or pick
            the flowers in blow?
     o, were that monster made my prize,
       how would i strive to wound that brow,
     how tear those horns, my frantic eyes
            adored but now!
     shameless i left my father's home;
       shameless i cheat the expectant grave;
     o heaven, that naked i might roam
            in lions' cave!
     now, ere decay my bloom devour
       or thin the richness of my blood,
     fain would i fall in youth's first flower,
            the tigers' food.
     hark! 'tis my father--worthless one!
       what, yet alive? the oak is nigh.
     'twas well you kept your maiden zone,
            the noose to tie.
     or if your choice be that rude pike,
       new barb'd with death, leap down and ask
     the wind to bear you. would you like
            the bondmaid's task,
     you, child of kings, a master's toy,
       a mistress' slave?'" beside her, lo!
     stood venus smiling, and her boy
            with unstrung bow.
     then, when her laughter ceased, "have done
       with fume and fret," she cried, "my fair;
     that odious bull will give you soon
            his horns to tear.
     you know not you are jove's own dame:
       away with sobbing; be resign'd
     to greatness: you shall give your name
            to half mankind."

       now the noon has pass'd the full,
     yet sure you deem swift time has made a halt,
       tardy as you are to pull
     old bibulus' wine-jar from its sleepy vault.

       hers our latest song, who sways

     heir of tyrrhenian kings, for you
       a mellow cask, unbroach'd as yet,
     maecenas mine, and roses new,
       and fresh-drawn oil your locks to wet,
     are waiting here. delay not still,
       nor gaze on tibur, never dried,
     and sloping aesule, and the hill
       of telegon the parricide.
     o leave that pomp that can but tire,
       those piles, among the clouds at home;
     cease for a moment to admire
       the smoke, the wealth, the noise of rome!
     in change e'en luxury finds a zest:
       the poor man's supper, neat, but spare,
     with no gay couch to seat the guest,
       has smooth'd the rugged brow of care.
     now glows the ethiop maiden's sire;
       now procyon rages all ablaze;
     the lion maddens in his ire,
       as suns bring back the sultry days:
     the shepherd with his weary sheep
       seeks out the streamlet and the trees,
     silvanus' lair: the still banks sleep
       untroubled by the wandering breeze.
     you ponder on imperial schemes,
       and o'er the city's danger brood:
     bactrian and serian haunt your dreams,
       and tanais, toss'd by inward feud.
     the issue of the time to be
       heaven wisely hides in blackest night,
     and laughs, should man's anxiety
       transgress the bounds of man's short sight.
     control the present: all beside
       flows like a river seaward borne,
     now rolling on its placid tide,
       now whirling massy trunks uptorn,
     and waveworn crags, and farms, and stock,
       in chaos blent, while hill and wood
     reverberate to the enormous shock,
       when savage rains the tranquil flood
     have stirr'd to madness. happy he,
       self-centred, who each night can say,
     "my life is lived: the morn may see
       a clouded or a sunny day:
     that rests with jove: but what is gone,
       he will not, cannot turn to nought;
     nor cancel, as a thing undone,
       what once the flying hour has brought."
     fortune, who loves her cruel game,
       still bent upon some heartless whim,
     shifts her caresses, fickle dame,
       now kind to me, and now to him:
     she stays; 'tis well: but let her shake
       those wings, her presents i resign,
     cloak me in native worth, and take
       chaste poverty undower'd for mine.
     though storms around my vessel rave,
       i will not fall to craven prayers,
     nor bargain by my vows to save
       my cyprian and sidonian wares,
     else added to the insatiate main.
       then through the wild aegean roar
     the breezes and the brethren twain
       shall waft my little boat ashore.

     nor the long lapse of immemorial time.
       i shall not wholly die: large residue
       shall 'scape the queen of funerals. ever new
     my after fame shall grow, while pontiffs climb
     with silent maids the capitolian height.
       "born," men will say, "where aufidus is loud,
       where daunus, scant of streams, beneath him bow'd

         let him smile in triumph gay,
     true heart, victorious over lavish hand,
         by the alban lake that day
     'neath citron roof all marble shalt thou stand:
         incense there and fragrant spice
     with odorous fumes thy nostrils shall salute;
         blended notes thine ear entice,
     the lyre, the pipe, the berecyntine flute:
         graceful youths and maidens bright
     shall twice a day thy tuneful praise resound,
         while their feet, so fair and white,
     in salian measure three times beat the ground.
         i can relish love no more,
     nor flattering hopes that tell me hearts are true,
         nor the revel's loud uproar,
     nor fresh-wreathed flowerets, bathed in vernal dew.
         ah! but why, my ligurine,
     steal trickling tear-drops down my wasted cheek?
         wherefore halts this tongue of mine,
     so eloquent once, so faltering now and weak?
         now i hold you in my chain,
     and clasp you close, all in a nightly dream;
         now, still dreaming, o'er the plain
     i chase you; now, ah cruel! down the stream.

     pindar, like torrent from the steep
       which, swollen with rain, its banks o'erflows,
     with mouth unfathomably deep,
            foams, thunders, glows,
     all worthy of apollo's bay,
       whether in dithyrambic roll
     pouring new words he burst away
             beyond control,
     or gods and god-born heroes tell,
       whose arm with righteous death could tame
     grim centaurs, tame chimaeras fell,
            out-breathing flame,
     or bid the boxer or the steed
       in deathless pride of victory live,
     and dower them with a nobler meed
            than sculptors give,
     or mourn the bridegroom early torn
       from his young bride, and set on high
     strength, courage, virtue's golden morn,
            too good to die.
     antonius! yes, the winds blow free,
       when dirce's swan ascends the skies,
     to waft him. i, like matine bee,
           in act and guise,
     that culls its sweets through toilsome hours,
       am roaming tibur's banks along,
     and fashioning with puny powers
           a laboured song.
     your muse shall sing in loftier strain
       how caesar climbs the sacred height,
     the fierce sygambrians in his train,
           with laurel dight,
     than whom the fates ne'er gave mankind
       a richer treasure or more dear,
     nor shall, though earth again should find
           the golden year.
     your muse shall tell of public sports,
       and holyday, and votive feast,
     for caesar's sake, and brawling courts
           where strife has ceased.
     then, if my voice can aught avail,
       grateful for him our prayers have won,
     my song shall echo, "hail, all hail,
           auspicious sun!"
     there as you move, "ho! triumph, ho!
       great triumph!" once and yet again
     all rome shall cry, and spices strow
           before your train.
     ten bulls, ten kine, your debt discharge:
       a calf new-wean'd from parent cow,
     battening on pastures rich and large,
           shall quit my vow.

        whom jove o'er all the feather'd breed
     made sovereign, having proved him sure
       erewhile on auburn ganymede;
     stirr'd by warm youth and inborn power,
       he quits the nest with timorous wing,
     for winter's storms have ceased to lower,
       and zephyrs of returning spring
     tempt him to launch on unknown skies;
       next on the fold he stoops downright;
     last on resisting serpents flies,
       athirst for foray and for flight:
     as tender kidling on the grass
       espies, uplooking from her food,
     a lion's whelp, and knows, alas!
       those new-set teeth shall drink her blood:
     so look'd the raetian mountaineers
       on drusus:--whence in every field
     they learn'd through immemorial years
       the amazonian axe to wield,
     i ask not now: not all of truth
       we seekers find: enough to know
     the wisdom of the princely youth
       has taught our erst victorious foe
     what prowess dwells in boyish hearts
       rear'd in the shrine of a pure home,
     what strength augustus' love imparts
       to nero's seed, the hope of rome.
     good sons and brave good sires approve:
       strong bullocks, fiery colts, attest
     their fathers' worth, nor weakling dove
       is hatch'd in savage eagle's nest.
     but care draws forth the power within,
       and cultured minds are strong for good:
     let manners fail, the plague of sin
       taints e'en the course of gentle blood.
     how great thy debt to nero's race,
       o rome, let red metaurus say,
     slain hasdrubal, and victory's grace
       first granted on that glorious day
     which chased the clouds, and show'd the sun,
       when hannibal o'er italy
     ran, as swift flames o'er pine-woods run,
       or eurus o'er sicilia's sea.
     henceforth, by fortune aiding toil,
       rome's prowess grew: her fanes, laid waste
     by punic sacrilege and spoil,
       beheld at length their gods replaced.
     then the false libyan own'd his doom:--
       "weak deer, the wolves' predestined prey,
     blindly we rush on foes, from whom
       'twere triumph won to steal away.
     that race which, strong from ilion's fires,
       its gods, on tuscan waters tost,
     its sons, its venerable sires,
       bore to ausonia's citied coast;
     that race, like oak by axes shorn
       on algidus with dark leaves rife,
     laughs carnage, havoc, all to scorn,
       and draws new spirit from the knife.
     not the lopp'd hydra task'd so sore
       alcides, chafing at the foil:
     no pest so fell was born of yore
       from colchian or from theban soil.
     plunged in the deep, it mounts to sight
       more splendid: grappled, it will quell
     unbroken powers, and fight a fight
       whose story widow'd wives shall tell.
     no heralds shall my deeds proclaim
       to carthage now: lost, lost is all:
     a nation's hope, a nation's name,
       they died with dying hasdrubal."
     what will not claudian hands achieve?
       jove's favour is their guiding star,
     and watchful potencies unweave
       for them the tangled paths of war.

     best guardian of rome's people, dearest boon

       ah! when, like spring, that gracious mien of thine
     dawns on thy rome, more gently glides the day,
           and suns serener shine.
     see her whose darling child a long year past
       has dwelt beyond the wild carpathian foam;
     that long year o'er, the envious southern blast
           still bars him from his home:
     weeping and praying to the shore she clings,

     so, smit by loyal passion's restless stings,
           rome for her caesar yearns.
     in safety range the cattle o'er the mead:
       sweet peace, soft plenty, swell the golden grain:
     o'er unvex'd seas the sailors blithely speed:
           fair honour shrinks from stain:
     no guilty lusts the shrine of home defile:
       cleansed is the hand without, the heart within:
     the father's features in his children smile:
           swift vengeance follows sin.
     who fears the parthian or the scythian horde,
       or the rank growth that german forests yield,
     while caesar lives? who trembles at the sword
           the fierce iberians wield?
     in his own hills each labours down the day,
       teaching the vine to clasp the widow'd tree:
     then to his cups again, where, feasting gay,
           he hails his god in thee.
     a household power, adored with prayers and wine,
       thou reign'st auspicious o'er his hour of ease:
     thus grateful greece her castor made divine,
           and her great hercules.
     ah! be it thine long holydays to give
       to thy hesperia! thus, dear chief, we pray
     at sober sunrise; thus at mellow eve,
           when ocean hides the day.

       as cunning scopas or parrhasius wrought,
       this with the brush, that with the chisel taught
     to image now a mortal, now a god.
     but these are not my riches: your desire
       such luxury craves not, and your means disdain:
       a poet's strain you love; a poet's strain
     accept, and learn the value of the lyre.
     not public gravings on a marble base,
       whence comes a second life to men of might
       e'en in the tomb: not hannibal's swift flight,
     nor those fierce threats flung back into his face,
     not impious carthage in its last red blaze,
       in clearer light sets forth his spotless fame,
       who from crush'd afric took away--a name,
     than rude calabria's tributary lays.
     let silence hide the good your hand has wrought.
       farewell, reward! had blank oblivion's power
       dimm'd the bright deeds of romulus, at this hour,
     despite his sire and mother, he were nought.
     thus aeacus has 'scaped the stygian wave,
       by grace of poets and their silver tongue,
       henceforth to live the happy isles among.
     no, trust the muse: she opes the good man's grave,
     and lifts him to the gods. so hercules,
       his labours o'er, sits at the board of jove:
       so tyndareus' offspring shine as stars above,
     saving lorn vessels from the yawning seas:
     so bacchus, with the vine-wreath round his hair,
       gives prosperous issue to his votary's prayer.

     think not those strains can e'er expire,
       which, cradled 'mid the echoing roar
     of aufidus, to latium's lyre
       i sing with arts unknown before.
     though homer fill the foremost throne,
       yet grave stesichorus still can please,
     and fierce alcaeus holds his own,
       with pindar and simonides.
     the songs of teos are not mute,
       and sappho's love is breathing still:
     she told her secret to the lute,
       and yet its chords with passion thrill.
     not sparta's queen alone was fired
       by broider'd robe and braided tress,
     and all the splendours that attired
       her lover's guilty loveliness:
     not only teucer to the field
       his arrows brought, nor ilion
     beneath a single conqueror reel'd:
       not crete's majestic lord alone,
     or sthenelus, earn'd the muses' crown:
       not hector first for child and wife,
     or brave deiphobus, laid down
       the burden of a manly life.
     before atrides men were brave:
       but ah! oblivion, dark and long,
     has lock'd them in a tearless grave,
       for lack of consecrating song.
     'twixt worth and baseness, lapp'd in death,
       what difference? you shall ne'er be dumb,
     while strains of mine have voice and breath:
       the dull neglect of days to come
     those hard-won honours shall not blight:
       no, lollius, no: a soul is yours,
     clear-sighted, keen, alike upright
       when fortune smiles, and when she lowers:
     to greed and rapine still severe,
       spurning the gain men find so sweet:
     a consul, not of one brief year,
       but oft as on the judgment-seat
     you bend the expedient to the right,
       turn haughty eyes from bribes away,
     or bear your banners through the fight,
       scattering the foeman's firm array.
     the lord of boundless revenues,
       salute not him as happy: no,
     call him the happy, who can use
       the bounty that the gods bestow,
     can bear the load of poverty,
       and tremble not at death, but sin:
     no recreant he when called to die
       in cause of country or of kin.

     here is a cask of alban, more
       than nine years old: here grows
     green parsley, phyllis, and good store
           of ivy too
      (wreathed ivy suits your hair, you know)
       the plate shines bright: the altar, strewn
     with vervain, hungers for the flow
           of lambkin's blood.
     there's stir among the serving folk;
       they bustle, bustle, boy and girl;
     the flickering flames send up the smoke
           in many a curl.
     but why, you ask, this special cheer?
       we celebrate the feast of ides,
     which april's month, to venus dear,
           in twain divides.
     o, 'tis a day for reverence,
       e'en my own birthday scarce so dear,
     for my maecenas counts from thence
           each added year.
     'tis telephus that you'd bewitch:
       but he is of a high degree;
     bound to a lady fair and rich,
           he is not free.
     o think of phaethon half burn'd,
       and moderate your passion's greed:
     think how bellerophon was spurn'd
           by his wing'd steed.
     so learn to look for partners meet,
       shun lofty things, nor raise your aims
     above your fortune. come then, sweet,
           my last of flames
      (for never shall another fair
       enslave me), learn a tune, to sing
     with that dear voice: to music care
           shall yield its sting.

     the gales of thrace, that hush the unquiet sea,
       spring's comrades, on the bellying canvas blow:
     clogg'd earth and brawling streams alike are free
         from winter's weight of snow.
     wailing her itys in that sad, sad strain,
       builds the poor bird, reproach to after time
     of cecrops' house, for bloody vengeance ta'en
         on foul barbaric crime.
     the keepers of fat lambkins chant their loves
       to silvan reeds, all in the grassy lea,
     and pleasure him who tends the flocks and groves
         of dark-leaved arcady.
     it is a thirsty season, virgil mine:
       but would you taste the grape's calenian juice,
     client of noble youths, to earn your wine
         some nard you must produce.
     a tiny box of nard shall bring to light
       the cask that in sulpician cellar lies:
     o, it can give new hopes, so fresh and bright,
         and gladden gloomy eyes.
     you take the bait? then come without delay
       and bring your ware: be sure, 'tis not my plan
     to let you drain my liquor and not pay,
         as might some wealthy man.
     come, quit those covetous thoughts, those knitted brows,
       think on the last black embers, while you may,
     and be for once unwise. when time allows,
         'tis sweet the fool to play.

     the gods have heard, the gods have heard my prayer;
       yes, lyce! you are growing old, and still
           you struggle to look fair;
             you drink, and dance, and trill
     your songs to youthful love, in accents weak
       with wine, and age, and passion. youthful love!
         he dwells in chia's cheek,
           and hears her harp-strings move.
     rude boy, he flies like lightning o'er the heath
       past wither'd trees like you; you're wrinkled now;
         the white has left your teeth
           and settled on your brow.
     your coan silks, your jewels bright as stars,
       ah no! they bring not back the days of old,
         in public calendars
           by flying time enroll'd.
     where now that beauty? where those movements? where
       that colour? what of her, of her is left,
         who, breathing love's own air,
           me of myself bereft,
     who reign'd in cinara's stead, a fair, fair face,
       queen of sweet arts? but fate to cinara gave
         a life of little space;
           and now she cheats the grave
     of lyce, spared to raven's length of days,
       that youth may see, with laughter and disgust,
         a fire-brand, once ablaze,
           now smouldering in grey dust.

     what honours can a grateful rome,
       a grateful senate, caesar, give
     to make thy worth through days to come
       emblazon'd on our records live,
     mightiest of chieftains whomsoe'er
       the sun beholds from heaven on high?
     they know thee now, thy strength in war,
       those unsubdued vindelici.
     thine was the sword that drusus drew,
       when on the breunian hordes he fell,
     and storm'd the fierce genaunian crew
       e'en in their alpine citadel,
     and paid them back their debt twice told;
       'twas then the elder nero came
     to conflict, and in ruin roll'd
       stout raetian kernes of giant frame.
     o, 'twas a gallant sight to see
       the shocks that beat upon the brave
     who chose to perish and be free!
       as south winds scourge the rebel wave
     when through rent clouds the pleiads weep,
       so keen his force to smite, and smite
     the foe, or make his charger leap
       through the red furnace of the fight.
     thus daunia's ancient river fares,
       proud aufidus, with bull-like horn,
     when swoln with choler he prepares
       a deluge for the fields of corn.
     so claudius charged and overthrew
       the grim barbarian's mail-clad host,
     the foremost and the hindmost slew,
       and conquer'd all, and nothing lost.
     the force, the forethought, were thine own,
       thine own the gods. the selfsame day
     when, port and palace open thrown,
       low at thy footstool egypt lay,
     that selfsame day, three lustres gone,
       another victory to thine hand
     was given; another field was won
       by grace of caesar's high command.
     thee spanish tribes, unused to yield,
       mede, indian, scyth that knows no home,
     acknowledge, sword at once and shield
       of italy and queenly rome.
     ister to thee, and tanais fleet,
       and nile that will not tell his birth,
     to thee the monstrous seas that beat
       on britain's coast, the end of earth,
     to thee the proud iberians bow,
       and gauls, that scorn from death to flee;
     the fierce sygambrian bends his brow,
       and drops his arms to worship thee

     of battles fought i fain had told,
       and conquer'd towns, when phoebus smote
     his harp-string: "sooth, 'twere over-bold
       to tempt wide seas in that frail boat."
     thy age, great caesar, has restored
       to squalid fields the plenteous grain,
     given back to rome's almighty lord
       our standards, torn from parthian fane,
     has closed quirinian janus' gate,
       wild passion's erring walk controll'd,
     heal'd the foul plague-spot of the state,
       and brought again the life of old,
     life, by whose healthful power increased
       the glorious name of latium spread
     to where the sun illumes the east
       from where he seeks his western bed.
     while caesar rules, no civil strife
       shall break our rest, nor violence rude,
     nor rage, that whets the slaughtering knife
       and plunges wretched towns in feud.
     the sons of danube shall not scorn
       the julian edicts; no, nor they
     by tanais' distant river born,
       nor persia, scythia, or cathay.
     and we on feast and working-tide,
       while bacchus' bounties freely flow,
     our wives and children at our side,
       first paying heaven the prayers we owe,
     shall sing of chiefs whose deeds are done,
       as wont our sires, to flute or shell,
     and troy, anchises, and the son
       of venus on our tongues shall dwell.

     on which the sibyl's volume wills
       that youths and maidens without stain
     to gods, who love the seven dear hills,
           should chant the strain!
     sun, that unchanged, yet ever new,
       lead'st out the day and bring'st it home,
     may nought be present to thy view
           more great than rome!
     blest ilithyia! be thou near
       in travail to each roman dame!
     lucina, genitalis, hear,
           whate'er thy name!
     o make our youth to live and grow!
       the fathers' nuptial counsels speed,
     those laws that shall on rome bestow
           a plenteous seed!
     so when a hundred years and ten
       bring round the cycle, game and song
     three days, three nights, shall charm again
           the festal throng.
     ye too, ye fates, whose righteous doom,

     link on new blessings, yet to come,
           to blessings given!
     let earth, with grain and cattle rife,
       crown ceres' brow with wreathen corn;
     soft winds, sweet waters, nurse to life
           the newly born!
     o lay thy shafts, apollo, by!
       let suppliant youths obtain thine ear!
     thou moon, fair "regent of the sky,"
           thy maidens hear!
     if rome is yours, if troy's remains,
       safe by your conduct, sought and found
     another city, other fanes
           on tuscan ground,
     for whom, 'mid fires and piles of slain,
       aeneas made a broad highway,
     destined, pure heart, with greater gain.
           their loss to pay,
     grant to our sons unblemish'd ways;
       grant to our sires an age of peace;
     grant to our nation power and praise,
           and large increase!
     see, at your shrine, with victims white,
       prays venus and anchises' heir!
     o prompt him still the foe to smite,
           the fallen to spare!
     now media dreads our alban steel,
       our victories land and ocean o'er;
     scythia and ind in suppliance kneel,
           so proud before.
     faith, honour, ancient modesty,
       and peace, and virtue, spite of scorn,
     come back to earth; and plenty, see,
           with teeming horn.
     augur and lord of silver bow,
       apollo, darling of the nine,
     who heal'st our frame when languors slow
           have made it pine;
     lov'st thou thine own palatial hill,
       prolong the glorious life of rome
     to other cycles, brightening still
           through time to come!
     from algidus and aventine
       list, goddess, to our grave fifteen!
     to praying youths thine ear incline,
           diana queen!
     thus jove and all the gods agree!
       so trusting, wend we home again,
     phoebus and dian's singers we,
           and this our strain.
