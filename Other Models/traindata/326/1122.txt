
introduction.




the editor of the new edition of mother goose's melodies knows much
more about the curious history of the boston edition than i do.  and
the reader will not need, even in these lines of mine, any light
on the curious question about madam vergoose, or her son-in-law
mr. fleet, or the contes de ma mere l'oye, which are so carefully
discussed in the preface.  all this is admirably discussed
also in mr. william whitmore's paper published in albany in 1889,
and reprinted in boston in 1892.  in that paper he reproduced in
facsimile isaiah thomas's edition of mother goose published first
in 1785.

what i want to tell, is of mother goose in the nineteenth century--the
mother goose on which the old boston line was brought up--a line
now nearly forgotten.  but there were days, gentle reader, when an
excellent body of people in this little town of boston grew up all
together loving and loved, brought up their children here, loving
and loved, and amused those children from babyhood in their own
way.  the centre of the baby life of this race was mother goose's
melodies in the dear little quarto edition, of which a precise copy
is in the reader's hands.

it is this mother goose of which the new englander, if his age be
more than three score years and ten, speaks when he speaks of mother
goose at all.  the historical ear marks in it are rather curious.
perhaps the printing of this very edition may raise up some antiquary
who can tell us how it came into existence.  i wish i knew.  i hope
some reader of these lines may know.  what i know is this, that
when the nineteenth century began, in the years from 1800 to 1820,
the impression of what we still called the "mother country" upon
boston was very strong.  the old nurse who took care of me in my
babyhood spoke of "weal" and "winegar," where my father and mother
spoke of veal and vinegar, just as if she had been a london cockney.
children played the games of english origin,


"lady queen anne, she sits on her throne,"


though it were fifty years after the declaration of independence.
i may say in passing, that within the last dozen years i stopped
to hear some north end children sing the song queen anne, without
the slightest idea, i suppose, of who queen anne was, or what was
their business with her.  alas, and alas, i did not write down the
words of that song on the moment!

the truth is that boston was still a place of foreign commerce.
our ties with london, such as john adams and other revolutionaries
spoke of so freely, still existed, and a baby's song book like
mother goose, might still recall, and i suppose repeat, the song
of cockney homes.

so in the nursery, whether one of the north end sailors' home, or
of beacon street, or park street, or pearl street, the baby was
sung to sleep with london ditties.


london bridge is broken down,
   dance over, my lady lee,
london bridge is broken down,
   with a fair ladye.
will not some of the active literary clubs of st. ethelburger's
church in bishopsgate, in east london, tell us what this means:


you owe me five shillings,
say the bells of st. helen's.
when will you pay me?
say the bells of old bailey.
when i grow rich,
say the bells of shoreditch.
pokers and tongs,
say the bells of st. john's.
kettles and pans,
say the bells of st. ann's.
half-pence and farthings,
say the bells of st. martin's.


all this was sung to new england children, thank god without note
or comment, and with no other explanation.  but the american traveler
who goes into baring brothers', bishopsgate, with his credit, feels
a thrill which the clerk who attends to him does not understand,
if one speaks to him of st. helen's or st. ann's.

all this accounts for mother goose as fleet reprinted her baby songs
as early as the year 1700.  but as the reader will see, somebody
had the editing of the baby's text book who was not afraid of his
own time.  i think that the very latest verses which will be found
here are those of scott's donald dhu.  walter scott wrote this
for campbell's anthology in 1816.  the presence of these verses
fixes the latest date of any lines in the collection, except, as
mr. whitmore has observed, the line "boston town" is changed into
"boston city," so that must have been written after 1822.

but it is interesting to see that no american line of comment seems
to have slipped in.  there was no lack of nationalism in the air,
but i cannot find any reference to a cent[*], a dime, a governor,
or a president.  now in the printed handkerchiefs, such as children
used to buy on election day in the street, i remember the ballad
of john gilpin ended,


now, let us sing, "long live the president
         and gilpin, long live he."
but the wise editor of our boston mother goose had no such fears
for the republicanism of his baby hearers.  those were happy years
in which the imagination of babies and their older brothers and
sisters were permitted to run free.

[*][note from brett:  see the rhyme which starts "little jack
nory..." for such a reference.]

i have asked and asked and have received no answer, as to the artist
who made many of the admirable designs which are distinctive in
this book.  abel bowen's[*] name is signed to one, and his initials
appear on several.  n.d. means nathaniel dearborn[+].  one is signed
"chicket,"[&] but this does not account for the greater number
of them.  i was the son of a printer and type-founder, so we had
a "type book" as a classic in our nursery.  so i knew even as a
little child, that there were pictures in mother goose which were
put there merely because the block from which they were printed
existed in the printer's office.  but there were other designs made
by some artist of genius; and who was he?  he represented the man
in the moon, hanging with one arm to the crescent of the moon.  that
man, whoever he was, is to be ranked among the original artists of
the world.  he gave to childhood his first and best images of the
blackbirds who were baked in the pie.

[*][note from brett:  abel bowen (1790-1850) was boston's first
wood engraver and is perhaps most well known for his work on the
"farmer's almanac."]

[+][note from brett:  nathanial dearborn (1786-1852) was with the
holland printing company and is perhaps most well known (in 2002)
for the difficulty he had in setting plates for a 13 cent stamp
used in hawaii (second issue).  he also was a printer and author
of "the american textbook for making letters."  he would have been
well remembered in boston at the time of this book.]

[&][note from brett:  "chicket" is terribly obscure and the
only reference i could possibly find was to a mr. chicket who was
apparently murdered in a bar (the brushmakers arms) in upham, new
hampshire and supposedly haunts the bar.  whether this has anything
to do with the chicket in the text is highly questionable, but
would make for a great story.]

this question i have asked again and again, and no man and no woman
has answered it.  but the chances seem to be that we owe them also
to abel bowen, the first wood engraver recorded among the engravers
in the period after the revolution.  we have specimens of his work
more in pictures of landscape or of buildings than in drawings of
men and women.  but there can be but little doubt that most of the
blocks from which the mother goose of our childhood were printed
were engraved by him, and there seems to be good reason to believe
that the designs were by him as well.  the pity is that no old
portfolio can be found with other designs from his pencil.  but,
alas, the chances are that they have gone where so many other
manuscripts have gone, which would delight the antiquaries.

thanks to the publisher and editor of this book, the designs, of
whatever hand, are now preserved for another generation.

i have said that i am not learned in the interesting genealogical
discussion of the subject, but i like to call attention to the fact
that the english norwich was the birthplace and home of fleet, and
that it is possible that in the annals of that city light may be
gained as to the history of the man in the moon.

i have always thoughtt that the close connection of our maritime
people with london had something to do with the names of our streets.
the most striking instance is in the name of cornhill, where this
very thomas fleet had his book store, and where book stores have
been an institution from that day to this.  our cornhill in its
relations to our water front occupies the same conditions which
the london cornhill had and has to the river front in london.  the
young reader should remember that washington street so far as it had
one name was called the main street.  coming north from our dover
street, the traveler passed through orange street, then through
newbury street, next through marlborough street, which extended
from winter street to school street, and then through cornhill
northward to dock square.  this is precisely as in passing east
through what was the main street of london of those days, the traveler
would have passed through the cornhill of that thoroughfare.  the
london cornhill retains its name.  ours was changed in 1824 to the
all-conquering name of washington, which is now applied to the whole
of the "main street" and "the neck" of the fathers, as indeed, it
is applied by local authorities many miles further.

but in familiar conversation, the old name cornhill was retained
for a generation, and indeed, would be understood to-day, if you
were speaking to boston people more than fifty years old.  the name
cornhill is now applied to the market street of an earlier period.

young readers should remember that orange street, newbury street,
and marlborough street were names given in honour of the prince
of orange of the puritan victory at newbury, and of the duke
of marlborough.  all of them show what were the whig and puritan
feelings of the people who gave them.  all three of the names in
our time have been transferred from the old localities.

we are all greatly obliged to mrs. harriet blackstone c. butler for
the pains she has taken to rescue for popular use this interesting
memorial of the education of the fathers and mothers of new england.

wise, and of my own family name.  these old women, who never had
chick nor child of their own, but who always know how to bring up

my enchanting, quieting, soothing volume, my all-sufficient anodyne

[from the boston transcript.]


cotton mather and mother goose.


mr. editor:--your correspondent, n.b.s., has so decisively given
a quietus to the question as to the birthplace of cotton mather,
that there is no danger of its ever being revived again.  but there
is another question of equal importance to many, to the literary
world in particular, which should in like manner be put to rest.
who was mother goose? and when were her melodies first given to the
world?  these are questions which have been often asked, but have
never been satisfactorily answered.  the recent publication of a
book called "mother goose for old folks" has again revived these
questions, which serves to show that the subject has not yet lost
its interest.

many persons imagine that mother goose is a myth,--that no such
person ever existed.  this is a mistake.  mother goose was not
only a veritable personage, but was born and resided many years in
boston, where many of her descendants may now be found.  the last
that bore this ancient paternal cognomen died about the year 1807,
and was buried in the old granary burying ground, where probably lie
the remains of the whole blood, if we may judge from the numerous
grave-stones which mark their resting place.  the family originated in
england, but at what time they came to this country is unknown,--but
probably about the year 1656.  this was the "wealthy family of
goose" which is immortalized by mr. bowditch in his book of suffolk
names, who at the same time has immortalized himself.  they were
landholders in boston, so early as 1660.  nearly half the space
between west and winter streets, on washington street, and extending
westerly towards tremont street, 275 feet belonged to this family,
as did also a large tract of land on essex, rowe, and bedford
streets, upon which now stand two churches and a large number of
dwelling houses.  so much for mother goose.  now for her melodies.

it is well known to antiquarians that more than two hundred years
ago there was a small book in circulation in london bearing the
name of "rhymes for the nursery; or lulla-byes for children," which
contained many of the identical pieces which have been handed down
to us and now from part of the "mother goose's melodies" of the
present day.  it contained also other pieces much more silly, if
possible, and some that the american types of the present day would
refuse to give off an impression.  the "cuts" or illustrations
thereof were of the coarsest description.

the first book of the kind known to be printed in this country bears
the title of "songs for the nursery; or, mother goose's melodies
for children."  something probably intended to represent a goose
with a very long neck and mouth wide open, covered a large part
of the title page, at the bottom of which, printed by t. fleet[*],
at his printing house, pudding lane, 1719.  price, two coppers.
several pages were missing, so that the whole number could not be
ascertained.

[*][note from brett:  t. fleet is probably thomas fleet (1685-1758)
and is referenced by john fleet elliot (a descendent).  thomas
fleet was married to elizabeth goose (aka vertigoose), and is the
presumed author.  unfortunately, modern research and research at
the time failed to substantiate the existence of this book.  this
information is culled in part from the introduction to l. frank
baum's edition of "mother goose" in 1897.  the introduction written
by mr. baum considered this line of reasoning and this article is
referenced by him.]

this t. fleet, according to isaiah thomas[*], was a man of considerable
talent and of great wit and humor.  he was born in england, and
was brought up in a printing office in the city of bristol, where
he afterwards worked as a journeyman.  although he was considered
a man of sense, he was never thought to be overburdened with
religious sentiments; he certainly was not in his latter days.  yet
he was more than suspected of being actively engaged in the riotous
proceedings connected with the trial of dr. sacheverell, in queen
ann's time.  in london, bristol, and many other places, the mobs
and riots were of a very serious nature.  in london several meeting
houses were sacked and pulled down, and the materials and contents
made into bonfires, and much valuable property destroyed.  several
of the rioters were arrested, tried and convicted.  the trials of
some of them are now before me.  how deeply fleet was implicated
in these disturbances was never known, but being of the same mind
with jack falstaff, that "the better part of valor is discretion,"
thought it prudent to put the ocean between himself and danger.  he
made his way to this country and arrived in boston, 1712.  being
a man of some enterprise he soon established a printing office in
pudding lane (now devonshire street), where he printed small books,
pamphlets, ballads, and such matter as offered.  being industrious
and prudent, he gradually accumulated property.  it was not long
before he became acquainted with the "wealthy family of goose,"
a branch of which he had before known in bristol, and was shortly
married to the eldest daughter.

[*][note from brett:  publisher of an american volume of mother
goose in 1787, "mother goose's melody:  or sonnets for the cradle."
this is a reprint of the collection put together by john newbury
(known for the newbury medal).]

by the record of marriages in the city registrar's office, it
appears that in "1715, june 8, was married by rev. cotton mather,
thomas fleet to elizabeth goose."  the happy couple took up their
residence in the same house with the printing office in pudding lane.
in due time their family was increased by the birth of a son and
heir.  mother goose, like all good grandmothers, was in ecstasies
at the event; her joy was unbounded; she spent her whole time in
the nursery, and in wandering about the house, pouring forth, in
not the most melodious strains, the songs and ditties which she
had learned in her younger days, greatly to the annoyance of the
whole neighborhood--to fleet in particular, who was a man fond of
quiet.  it was in vain he exhausted his shafts of wit and ridicule,
and every expedient he could devise:  it was of no use--the old lady
was not thus to be put down; so, like others similarly situated,
he was obliged to submit.  his shrewdness, however, did not forsake
him; from this seeming evil he contrived to educe some good; he
conceived the idea of collecting the songs and ditties as they came
from his mother, and such as he could gather from other sources,
and publishing them for the benefit of the world--not forgetting
himself.  this he did--and thus "mother goose's melodies" were
brought forth.  the adoption of this title was in derision of his
good mother-in-law, and was perfectly characteristic of the man,
as he was never known to spare his nearest friends in his raillery,
or when he could excite laughter at their expense.

cotton mather and mother goose thus stand in juxtaposition; and as
the former was instrumental in cementing the union, which resulted
in placing the latter so conspicuously before the world, it is but
just that it should be so,--although the one was a learned man,
a most voluminous writer, and published a great many books, some
wise and some foolish, it may well be doubted whether any one, or
all of them, together, have passed through so many editions,--been
read by so many hundreds of thousands, not to say millions,--put
so many persons to sleep, or in general done so much good to the
world as the simple melodies of the other.
