
tales of the mythical period

reconstruction of the culture.--in the first division certain actors
occur with great frequency, while others always take the leading
parts. these latter appear under a variety of names, two or more
titles often being used for the same individual in a single tale. to
avoid confusion a list of the fourteen principal actors and their
relationships are given in the accompanying table. it will appear that
there are some conflicts in the use of names, but when it is realized
that the first twenty-six myths which make up the cycle proper were
secured from six story tellers coming from four different towns,
the agreement rather than the disagreement is surprising. as a matter
of fact there is quite as much variation between the accounts of the
same narrator as between those gathered from different towns.

in consequence of modern rationalism there is a tendency on the
part of a considerable number of the tinguian to consider these
tales purely as stories and the characters as fictitious, but the
mass of the people hold them to be true and speak of the actors as
"the people who lived in the first times." for the present we shall
take their point of view and shall try to reconstruct the life in
"the first times" as it appears in the tales.

the principal actors live in kadalayapan and kaodanan, [7] towns
which our chief story teller--when trying to explain the desire of
kanag to go down and get fruit--assures us were somewhere in the air,
above the earth (p. 141). [8] at other times these places are referred
to as sudipan--the term by which spirits are supposed to call the
present earth--while the actors are referred to as ipogau--the spirit
name for tinguian. whatever its location it was a place much like the
present home of this people. the sky, the chief abode of spirits and
celestial bodies, was above the land, and the heroes of the tales
are pictured as ascending to visit the upper realms. the trees,
plants, and animals were for the most part those known to-day. the
ocean appears to have been well known, while mention is made of some
places in luzon, such as dagopan and san fernando in pangasinan with
which the people of to-day are not at all familiar (p. 89, 168).

we learn that each village is situated near to a river or waterway
by the banks of which shallow wells are dug, and there we find the
women gathering under the shade of the trees, dipping up water to be
carried to their homes, washing and combing their hair, and taking
their baths (p. 48). they seldom go singly, for enemies are apt to
be near, and unless several are in the company it will be impossible
to spread the alarm and secure help in case of attack (p. 43).

leading up from the spring to the village are bamboo poles on which
the heads of enemies are displayed (p. 43). in cases where the
warriors have been especially successful these trophies may surround
the whole settlement (p. 76). about the town is a defensive wall,
generally of bamboo, but in some cases made up entirely of gigantic
snakes (p. 43). within this inclosure are many houses. the bamboo
floors are raised high above the ground, while the thatching is of
grass. ladders lead up to little porches, from which doors open into
the dwellings. at least part of the houses have a cooking room in
addition to that used by the family, while structures containing a
ninth room are several times mentioned (pp. 43, 52, 85).

in one corner of the living room is a box containing blankets, above
which are pillows and mats used by members of the household and guests;
an iron caldron lies on the floor, while numerous chinese jars stand
about. a hearth, made up of a bed of ashes in which stones are sunk,
is used for cooking. above it is a bamboo food hanger, while near by
stand jars of water and various cooking pots. food baskets, coconut
shell cups, and dishes, and a quantity of chinese plates appear when
the meal is served, while the use of glass is not unknown. cups of
gold, wonderful jars, and plates appear at times, but seem to be so
rare as to excite comment (pp. 33, 98, 102, 105).

scattered through the village are numerous small buildings known as
balaua (p. 43), which are erected for the spirits during the greatest
of the ceremonies, and still inside the enclosure are the rice drying
plots and granaries, the latter raised high above the ground so as
to protect their contents from moisture (pp. 150).

about the town pigs and chickens roam at will, while half-starved
hunting dogs prowl about below the kitchens and fight for morsels
which drop from above (p. 99). carabao are kept and used as food
(p. 101), but in the cycle proper no mention is made of using them as
work animals. [9] game, especially deer and wild chickens, and fish
are added to the domestic supply of food (p. 80), but the staple
appears to be mountain rice. beans, coconuts, oranzes, sugar cane,
betel-nuts, and tobacco are also cultivated (pp. 33, 107, 121, 138).

clothing is scanty but nevertheless receives much attention. the
poorest of the men wear clouts of banana leaf, and the women, when in
danger of capture, don skirts of bark; but on most occasions we find
the man wearing a colored cotton clout, above which is a bright belt
of the same material, while for ceremonies he may add a short coat or
jacket. a headband, sometimes of gold, keeps his long hair in place,
and for very special events he may adorn each hair with a golden bead
(pp. 74, 76, 81)

the cotton skirts of the women reach from the waist to the knees;
the arms are covered with strands above strands of beads, while
strings of agate beads surround the neck or help to hold the hair in
place. to the real hair is often added a switch which appears to be
valued highly (p. 89). ornaments of gold adorn the ears, and finger
rings of the same metal are several times mentioned (pp. 39, 43, 124).

the tales afford us a glimpse of the daily life. in the early morning
the chilly mountain air drives the people from their mats to the yard,
where they squat about the fires (p. 132). as it becomes light,
part of the women begin pounding out the rice from its straw and
husks (p. 144), while others depart for the springs to secure water
(p. 101). in planting time husband and wife trudge together to the
fields, where the man plants the seeds or cuttings, and his wife
assists by pouring on water (p. 107). in midday, unless it is the busy
season, the village activities are practically suspended, and we see
the balaua filled with men, asleep or lounging, while children may be
playing about with tops or disk-like lipi seeds (p. 139). as it becomes
cooler, the town again takes on life; in the houses the women weave
blankets or prepare food, the older women feed the chickens and pigs
(p. 93), while the workers from the fields, or hunters with their
dogs and game, add to the general din and excitement (p. 80). when
night comes on, if it be in the dry season, bonfires spring up in
different parts of the village, and about them the girls and women
gather to spin. here also come the men and boys, to lounge and talk
(p. 117). a considerable portion of the man's time is taken up in
preparation for or actual participation in warfare (p. 74). we have
already seen that the constant danger of enemies makes it advisable
for the women to go in parties, even to the village spring. one tale
informs us of a girl who is left alone to guard the rice field and
is promptly killed by the alzado; [10] another states that "all the
tattooed igorot are enemies" (pp. 43, 155, 161).

revenge for the loss of relations or townspeople is a potent cause
of hostile raids; old feuds may be revived by taunts; but the chief
incentive appears to be the desire for renown, to be known as "a man
who goes to fight in the enemies' towns" (pp. 90, 59).

warriors sometimes go in parties, sometimes alone, but generally in
couples (p. 67). at times they lie in ambush and kill young girls
who go for water, or old men and women who pass their hiding place
(p. 97). again they go out boldly, armed with shield, spear, and
headaxe; they strike their shields as they go and announce their
presence to the enemy (p. 103). in five of the tales the heroes
challenge their opponents and then refuse to be the first to use their
weapons. it is only when their foes have tried in vain to injure them
that they enter the conflict. in such cases whole towns are wiped out
of existence and a great number of heads and a quantity of jars and
other booty is sent back to the towns of the victors (p. 104). peace
is restored in one instance by the payment of a number of valuable jars
(p. 91).

upon the return of a successful war party, the relatives meet them at
the gate of the town and compel them to climb the sangap; [11] then
invitations are sent out to friends and relatives in neighboring towns
to come and aid in the celebration of the victory (p. 140). when they
arrive at the entrance of the village they are met by the townspeople,
who offer them liquor and then conduct them to the houses where they
feast and dance to the music of gansas (p. 126).  [12] finally the
captured heads are stuck on the sagang  [13] and are placed by the
gate, the spring, and, if sufficient in number, surround the town
(p. 140). taking the heads of one's neighbors does not appear to
be common, yet cases are mentioned where visitors are treacherously
killed at a dance (pp. 78, 83).

the use of poison [14] is twice mentioned. in one case the victims
are killed by drinking liquor furnished by the father of the girl
about whose head they are dancing (pp. 148, 156).

bamboo spears appear to be used, but we are explicitly told that
they fought with steel weapons, and there are frequent references to
head-axes, spears, and knives (pp. 65, 76, 120).

marriage appears generally to be negotiated by the mother of the youth
at his suggestion (p. 128). at times both his parents go to the girl's
home, and after many preliminaries broach the subject of their mission
(p. 128). the girl's people discuss the proposition, and if they are
favorable they set a day for the pakalon--a celebration at which the
price to be paid for the bride is decided upon (p. 49). the parents
of the groom then return home after having left some small present,
such as a jar or an agate bead, as a sign of engagement (p. 128). [15]
the pakalon is held a few days later at the girl's home, and for
this event her people prepare a quantity of food (p. 72). on the
agreed day the close friends and relatives of both families will
assemble. those who accompany the groom carry jars and pigs, either
in part payment for the bride, or to serve as food for the company
(pp. 72, 128). the first hours are spent in bargaining over the
price the girl should bring, but when this is settled a feast is
prepared, and then all indulge in dancing the tadek (p. 59). [16]
when the payment is made a portion is distributed among the girl's
relatives (pp. 72, 74), but her parents retain the greater part for
themselves. [17] the groom cannot yet claim his bride, although in
one case he is allowed to take her immediately after the pakalon by
making a special payment for the privilege (p. 74). a few nights later
the groom goes to the girl's home carrying with him an empty jar with
which he makes the final payment (p. 73). the customary rice ceremony
[18] follows and he is then entitled to his bride (p. 73). should the
house or anything in it break at this time, it foretells misfortune
for the couple, hence precautions are taken lest such a sign should,
by accident, be given (p. 60).

in all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live
with his people. in the first instance their failure to do so raises a
protest; in the second, the girl's parents are of much more importance
than those of the groom, and this may explain their ability to retain
their daughter (pp. 138, 159).

when the bride reaches her future home, she sits on the bamboo floor
with her legs stretched out in front of her. the slats which she
covers are counted and a string of agate beads, equal in length to
the combined width of the slats, is given to her. she now becomes
a full member of the family and seems to be under the orders of her
mother-in-law (p. 60).

the tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near
relatives. dumanau, we are told, marries his cousin, [19] while we
frequently meet with such statements as, "we are relatives and it is
good for us to be married," or "they saw that they were related and
that both possessed magical power, so they were married (p. 35)." it
appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children
by her, yet leave her, and, without reproach, marry another better
fitted to be his wife (p. 54). he may also accept payment for a wife
who has deserted him, apparently without loss of prestige (p. 64). no
objection seems to be raised to a man having two wives so long as
one of these is an inhabitant of the upper world (p. 111), but we
find kanag telling his former sweetheart that he cannot marry her
since he is now married to another (p. 138). again, when two women
lay claim to aponitolau, as their husband, they undergo a test and
the loser returns to her former home (p. 94). however, this rule does
not prevent a man from having several concubines (p., 120). gawigawen,
we are told, is accompanied to a pakalon by eighteen young girls who
are his concubines (p. 59).

divorce is twice mentioned, but it seems to call out protest only
from the cast off wife (pp. 63, 149).

closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a
ceremony known as sayang, during the progress of which a number of
small structures--the largest known as balaua--are built. judging by
their names and descriptions, we are justified in considering them
"spirit houses" as they are to-day.

the details of the extended sayang ceremony are nowhere given, but
so much is made plain:--at its beginning many people pound rice,
for use in the offerings and for food, and da-eng [20] is danced
(p. 40). after the libon [21] invitations are sent out, by means of
betel-nuts covered with gold, to those whose presence is especially
desired (p. 62). when the guests arrive at the village spring or
gate they are offered food or drink, and then while they dance they
are sprinkled with water or rice, after which all go up to the town
(p. 41 note 2). a medium who knows the customs and desires of the
spirits constructs a bamboo mat, which is known as talapitap, and
on it offers food. to call their attention she frequently strikes
the ground with the dakidak--split sticks of bamboo and lono [22]
(p. 40). the guests are not neglected, so far as regards food, for
feasting and dancing occupy a considerable portion of their time. the
ceremonial dance da-eng is mentioned, but the tadek  [23] seems to
be the one in special favor (pp. 41, 59).

one tale tells us that the sayang was held immediately following a
head hunt; and another, that aponitolau went out to get the head of
an old man before he started this ceremony (pp. 69, 76); however,
the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to warfare.

on page 105 we are told that kanag's half sister is a medium, and the
description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with that
of to-day. at the sayang ceremony she is called to perform the dawak,
[24] with the assistance of the old woman alokotan (p. 106). the dawak
is also held in order to stop the flow of blood from aponitolau's
finger (p. 113). the only other ceremony mentioned is that made in
order to find a lost switch (p. 91).

certain well-known customs are strongly brought out in our
material. the first, and apparently most important, is the necessity
of offering liquor and food, both to strangers and to guests
(p. 58). refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple
decline to allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries
reject this gift (p. 73). old quarrels are closed by the tender of
food or drink, and friendships are cemented by the drinking of basi
[25] (p. 134). people meeting for the first time, and even friends
who have been separated for a while, chew betel-nut together and
tell their names and places of residence. we are repeatedly told
that it is necessary to chew the nut and make known their names, for
"we cannot tell our names unless we chew," and "it is bad for us if
we do not know each other's names when we talk." a certain etiquette
is followed at this time: old men precede the younger; people of the
home town, the visitors; and men always are before the women (pp. 45,
133). the conduct of awig when he serves liquor to the alzados [26]
is that of to-day, i.e., the person who serves always drinks before
passing it to others (p. 156).

certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come out
in the tales. we learn that it is not considered proper for a man
to eat with the wife of another during his absence, nor should they
start the meal before he comes in (p. 52). the master of a dance is
deeply chagrined and chides his wife severely, because she insists
on dancing before he has invited all the others to take their turns
(p. 70). greediness is reproved in children and aponitolau causes the
death of his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat his
wife (p. 116). unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification
for a man to abandon his wife and kill her admirer (p. 78); but kanag
appears as a hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought
his life (p. 121).

of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that
the women discard their arm beads, the mourners don old clothing, and
all wail for the dead (pp. 44, 90). three times we are told that the
deceased is placed on a tabalang, or raft, on which a live rooster is
fastened before it is set adrift on the river. in the tales the raft
and fowl are of gold, but this is surprising even to the old woman
alokotan, past whose home in nagbotobotan all these rafts must go
(p. 131).

up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of "the first
times" we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable to the
present day tinguian, although, as we shall see later, there are some
striking differences in customs and ideas. we have purposely left the
description of the people and their practice of magic to the last,
although their magical practices invade every activity of their lives,
for it is here that the greatest variations from present conditions
apparently occur.

these people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits,
especially with the liblibayan, [27] who appear to be little more
than their servants, with the evil spirits known as banbanayo,
[28] and with the alan [29] (p. 123). the alan, just mentioned,
are to-day considered as deformed spirits who live in the forests:
"they are as large as people but have wings and can fly; their toes
are at the back of their feet and their fingers point backwards from
their wrists." the several references to them in the tales such as
"you alan girls whose toes on your feet turn out" indicate they were
so considered in the first times (p. 161). some of them are addressed
as "you alan of the springs," and in one instance a man dives down
into the water where the alan live (p. 148), but in general their
homes seem to be similar to but much finer than those of the people
of kadalayapan and kaodanan. these spirits appear time after time as
the foster mothers of the leading characters: generally they secure
a drop of menstrual blood, a miscarriage, or the afterbirth, and all
unknown to the real parents, change them into children and raise them
(p. 83). these foster children are pictured as living in houses of
gold situated near springs, the pebbles of which are of gold or beads;
[30] the places where the women set the pots while dipping water are
big plates or dishes, while similar dishes form the stepping stones
leading up to the house. articles of gold are found in the dwellings
and valuable jars are numerous. when the true relationships of these
children are established they always go to their blood parents,
carrying with them these riches, which are a source of wonder and
comment (pp. 43, 64).

the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan have many dealings with
the celestial bodies. the big star bagbagak appears as the husband
of sinag--the moon--and father of the star maiden gaygayoma, who,
aponitolau assures his wife, is a spirit. when this girl comes down
to steal sugar-cane she takes off her star dress and appears as a
beautiful maiden; [31] she becomes enamored with aponitolau and takes
him to the sky, where he lives with her. they have a child, who later
marries in kadalayapan and thereafter stays below. upon the occasion
when aponitolau visits his first wife and fails to return to the sky
at the appointed time, a great company of stars are sent to fetch him,
with orders to devour him if he refuses to obey (p. 109, ff.).

in the first tale aponitolau himself appears as "the sun," "the
man who makes the sun," as "a round stone which rolls," but when
it is established that he is the son of a couple in kadalayapan he
apparently relinquishes his duties in the sky and goes to live in
the village of his people. with him goes his wife aponibolinayen, who
had been carried above by a vine. while at his post in the heavens,
aponitolau is closely associated with the big star, whose duty it is to
follow him in the sky. again we are told that aponitolau is taken up
by the spirit kabkabaga-an, whom he marries and by whom he has a son
(p. 114). in some instances this hero and his son kanag converse with
thunder and lightning, which appear at times not unlike human beings
(p. 100); but in the eighth relation the two kinds of lightning are
pictured as dogs who guard the town of dona.

these people enjoy unusual relations with inanimate things, and we
find them conversing with spears and with jars. [32] in one case the
latter appear to be pastured like animals, and surround aponitolau when
he goes to feed them with lawed [33] leaves and salt (p. 51). weapons
weep blood and oil when taken down for the purpose of injuring certain
persons (p. 43). a nose flute, when played by a youth, tells him of
his mother's plight (p. 152), while a bamboo jew's harp summons the
brothers of its owner (p. 162). animals and birds are frequently in
communication with them: the hawk flies away and spreads the news of
the fight at adasin [34] (p. 90); at the bidding of dalonagan a spider
spins a web about the town (p. 124); and aponitolau is enabled to
fulfill the labors assigned him by the ten-headed giant only through
the aid of spiders, ants, and flies (p. 101). [35] during certain
dances the water from the river flows over the town and fish come
up and bite the feet of the dancers (p. 59). crocodiles are left to
guard the sister of aponibalagen, and when they fail to explain their
negligence they are whipped and sent away by their master (p. 87). a
great bird is pleased with aponitolau and carries him away [36] to its
home, where it forces him to marry a woman it had previously captured
(p. 92). in one instance an animal gives birth to a human child; a frog
laps up the spittle of aponitolau, and as a result becomes pregnant
[37] and gives birth to a maiden who is taken away by the spirits
(p. 105). another account states that the three sons of aponitolau
and aponibolinayen are born as pigs, but later assume human form
(p. 116). kanag becomes a snake when he tries to secure the perfume
of baliwan, but is restored to human form when he bathes in a magic
well (p. 137). these and other mysterious happenings, many of which
are not explained as being due to their own volition, befall them;
thus ingiwan, while walking, is confronted by an impassable hill and
is compelled to cross the ocean, where he finds his future wife, but
upon his return the hill has vanished (p. 86). in other instances the
finger rings of people meeting for the first time exchange themselves
(p. 92). the headband of ligi flies away without his knowledge and
alights on the skirt of a girl who is bathing in the river. as a
result she becomes pregnant, and when the facts become known ligi is
recognized as the child's father (p. 144). it seems probable that
the superior powers are responsible for these occurrences, for in
at least one instance the great spirit kaboniyan steals a maiden and
turns her into a flock of birds, who talk with and assist the owner
of a rice field (p. 151).

while they thus appear to be to a certain extent under the control
of the spirits and to be surrounded by animals and inanimate things
with human intelligence and speech, the people of these "first times"
possess great power over nature: time and space are annihilated, for
at their will daylight comes at once (p. 150), or they are transported
to a place in an instant (p. 92). at their command people appear:
kanag creates betel-nut trees, then cuts the fruit into bits, which he
sows on the ground. from these come many people who are his neighbors,
and one of whom he marries (p. 121). the course of nature is changed:
a field is planted in an instant; the crops mature in a few days, and
the grain and fruits take themselves to the store-house (p. 150). a
strike-a-light turns into a hill which impedes pursuers (p. 75), [38]
while a belt or head-axe serves as a ferry across a body of water
(p. 84). a storm is called upon to carry a person or a building to
a distance (p. 121), and a spring is created by killing an old man
(p. 60). [39] prepared food appears at a word; a stick when cooked
becomes a fish, and though it is repeatedly broken and served it
always appears ready for service at meal time (p. 33); a small jar
containing a single grain of rice supplies an abundance of food;
another jar no larger than a fist furnishes drink for a company and
still remains a third full; while a single earring fills a pot with
gold [40] (pp. 47, 119, 123).

quite as easy as the creation of beings is the causing of sleep or
death. all the people of a village are put to sleep at the will of a
single person (p. 145) and albaga--while still at a distance--causes
the death of aponibolinayen (p. 44). at a word of command the spears
and head-axes of the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan go out
and kill great numbers of the enemy, and the heads and booty take
themselves in orderly fashion to towns of their new owners (pp. 66,
75). many methods of restoring the dead to life are employed; spittle
is applied to the wounds, or the victim is placed in a magic well,
but the common method is for the hero "to whip his perfume," [41]
whereupon the dead follow his commands (pp. 152, 157).

the birth of a child, to a woman of these times, is generally preceded
by an intense itching between the third and last fingers, and when this
spot is pricked the child pops out "like popped rice." [42] its growth
is always magical, for at each bath its stature increases by a span
(p. 102). within a few days the baby is a large child and then begins
deeds of valor worthy of the most renowned warriors (pp. 95, 96).

the power of assuming animal forms appears to be a common possession,
and we find the different characters changing themselves into
fireflies, ants, centipedes, omen birds, and in one case into oil [43]
(pp. 85, 99).

one of the most peculiar yet constantly used powers of these people
is their ability to send betel-nuts on various missions. whenever
an invitation to a ceremony or celebration is to be extended, nuts
covered with gold are oiled and sent out. they go to the intended
guest, state their errand, and, if refused, forthwith proceed to grow
on his knee, forehead, or pet pig, until pain or pity compels him to
accept (p. 146). in some cases it appears that the nuts themselves
possess the magic properties, for we find aponitolau demanding that
his conquered foes give him their betel-nuts with magic power (p. 91).

relationships can be readily ascertained by the chewing of these nuts,
for when the quids are laid down they are transformed into agate and
golden beads and lie in such a manner that the associations are fully
established (pp. 35, 36, 41).

enough has been mentioned to show how important a part magic and
magical practices play in the life of this people, but one further
reference should be made, since it is found in nearly every tale. when
the marriage price is settled upon, the mother of the groom exercises
her power and at once fills the spirit house with valuable jars and the
like; this is repeated until enough are gathered to meet the demands
of the girl's people (p. 133). even when the agreed sum has been
delivered we often find the girl's mother herself practicing magic,
to secure additional payment, and by raising her elbows or eyebrows
causing a part of the jars to vanish (pp. 133, 143).

despite their great gifts we find that these people are not
all-powerful and that they deem it wise to consult the omens before
starting on a task or a journey. the gall sack and liver of a pig are
eagerly examined, [44] while the calls of birds, actions of animals,
or signs received from the thunder and lightning regulate their
conduct. in cases where these warnings are disregarded misfortune or
death always overtakes the individual (pp. 48, 49, 100 ff).

death comes to them, but apparently is only a temporary state. the
deceased are often revived by some magical process (p. 152), but if
not the corpse is placed on a raft and is set adrift on the river. [45]
the streams and rivers, we are told, all flow past nagbotobotan before
they empty into the hole where all streams go. in this place lives the
old woman alokotan, who is related to the people of kadalayapan and
kaodanan. her duty it is to watch for dead relatives, to secure them,
and make them alive again (p. 132). she is the owner of a magic pool,
the waters of which revive the dead and renew youth.

comparison of the reconstructed culture with present day
conditions.--before passing to a consideration of the tales in the last
two divisions of our material, it may be well to compare the life and
beliefs of these "people of the first times" with those of the living
tinguian. kadalayapan and kaodanan appear, in a vague way, to have been
located in abra, for we learn that the ilocano, don carlos, went up the
river from baygan (vigan) [46] to kadalayapan; that the alzados [47]
lived near by; while the tattooed igorot occupied the land to the south
(pp. 77, 155). the villages were surrounded by defensive walls such as
were to be found about all tinguian villages until recent times, and
which are still to be seen about abang and other settlements. within
the walls were many houses, the descriptions of most of which would
fit the dwellings of to day. the one thing which seems foreign to
present conditions is the so-called "ninth room" which receives rather
frequent mention. there is nothing in the tales referring to buildings
or house construction which lends support to the contention of those
who seek to class the tinguian as a modified sub-group of igorot. [48]
the bontoc type of dwelling with its ground floor sleeping box and
its elevated one room kitchen and storage room is nowhere mentioned,
neither is there any indication that in past or present times the
tinguian had separate sleeping houses for the unmarried men and boys,
and for the girls, as do their neighbors to the south.

the other structures, such as the spirit houses, rice drying
frames, and granaries were similar to those seen to-day in all the
villages. likewise the house furnishings, the musical instruments,
and even the games of the children were such as are to be found at
present, while our picture of the village life given on page 6 still
fits nearly any tinguian settlement in abra. the animals mentioned
are all familiar to the present people, but it is worthy of note
that in the first twenty-six tales, which make up the cycle proper,
the horse is not mentioned, nor does the carabao appear to be used
as a work animal. still more important is the fact that the terraced
fields and the rice culture accompanying them, which to-day occupy
a predominant place in the economic life of the people, are nowhere
mentioned. on the other hand, the langpadan, or mountain rice,
assumes a place of great importance. references to the cultivation
of the land all seem to indicate that the "hoe culture," which is
still practiced to a limited extent, took the place of agriculture.

the clothing, hair dressing, and ornaments, worn by these people,
agree closely with those of to-day. beads seems to have been of
prime importance, but could scarcely have been more prized or more
used than at present. unless she be in mourning, the hair and neck
of each woman are now ornamented with strings of beads, many of them
of evident antiquity, while strands above strands cover the arms from
the wrist to the elbow or even reach to the shoulder. [49]

the wealth of a person seems to have been, to a large extent,
determined by the number of old jars in his possession. as at the
present time, they formed the basis of settlement for feuds, as payment
for a bride, and even figured in the marriage ceremony itself. the
jars, as judged from their names, were evidently of ancient chinese
manufacture, and possessed power of speech and motion similar to that
of human beings; but in a lesser measure the same type of jars have
similar powers to-day. [50]

the use of gold and jewels seems to have been common in the old times;
the latter are seldom seen in the district to-day, but the use of bits
of gold in the various ceremonies is still common, while earrings of
gold or copper are among the most prized possessions of the women. [51]
placer mining is well known to the igorot of the south, who melt and
cast the metal into various ornaments. so far as i am aware, this is
not practiced by the present tinguian, but may point back to a time
when the industry was known in this region, or when trade relations
with the south were much freer than in recent years.

the weapons of the warriors, which we are specifically told were of
metal, are identical with those seen at the present time, while the
methods of warfare agree with the accounts still told by the old men
of their youthful exploits.

a survey of the tales brings out boldly the fact that a headhunt was
one of the most important events in tinguian life. to-day stress of
circumstances has caused the custom to suffer a rapid decline, but
even now heads are occasionally taken, while most of the old men have
vivid recollections of the days when they fought "in the towns of their
enemies." a spirited account of a head celebration seen in the village
of lagangilang--from which ten of these tales were collected--will
be found in the writings of la gironiere, already referred to. [52]
it is important to note that this account, as well as those secured
from many warriors of the present generation, offers some striking
differences to the procedure in the olden days, particularly as regards
the disposal of the skulls. the tales tell of the heads being placed
on the sagang [53] at the spring, at the gate, or about the town,
after the celebration. certain of the present villages make use of
the sagang, but the more common type of head holder is the saloko,
[54] which still figures in many ceremonies. however, the heads only
remain in these receptacles until the day set for the festival. they
are then carried to the centre of the village and there, amid
great rejoicing, are cut open; the brains are removed and to them
are added the lobes of the ears and joints of the little fingers,
and the whole is then placed in the liquor, which is served to the
dancers. before the guests depart the skulls are broken into small
pieces and a fragment is presented to each male guest, who carries
it home and is thus often reminded of the valor of the takers. [55]
a study of tinguian beliefs furnishes an additional religious motive
for the taking of heads, but with the people of kadalayapan and
kaodanan revenge and the desire for renown were the prime incentives.

every tale emphasizes the importance of the sayang ceremony and
the spirit structure known as balaua. [56] the ceremony is nowhere
described in full, but the many details which are supplied show that
it was almost identical with that of to-day. the same is true of the
dawak, [57] which we find mentioned on three different occasions, and
of the ceremony made to aid in locating lost or stolen articles. the
most noticeable fact, to the person familiar with tinguian life,
is that these are the only ceremonies mentioned among the many known
and practiced at present. more than a score of different rites are
now well known to this people, and occupy a very considerable portion
of their time and attention during the first four months of the year.

the failure to make mention of these very important events is
explained, it seems to me, not by their absence, but by the fact that
these rites vary in importance and that the privilege of celebrating
them is hereditary in a family. should one not entitled to hold
such a ceremony desire to do so, he must first give, in order, all
the lesser events, a costly procedure extending over a period of
several years. the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan always appear
as being closely related to the spirit kaboniyan, [58] and exceedingly
powerful. it seems probable that the story teller takes it for granted
that all of them are entitled to hold the most important ceremony
known to the tinguian.

a prominent figure in these rites is the medium, through whom the
ancient people generally conversed with the spirits, but in exceptional
cases we found the heroes talking direct with the superior beings;
however, this gift is not confined to the men of old, for in such
tales as 55 and 59 people who are believed to have lived recently
have conversed with the spirits and have even been joined to them
in marriage.

the procedure in choosing a bride, the engagement, the pakalon, [59]
and the marriage proper are all those of the present day, but the
rules governing the marriage of relatives differ radically. as already
noted, one of the chief qualifications for marriage, among the people
of the tales, was relationship, and even cousins became husband and
wife. such a thing is unthinkable among the tinguian of to-day; first
cousins are absolutely barred from marrying, while even the union of
second cousins would cause a scandal, and it is very doubtful if such a
wife would be allowed to share in her deceased husband's property. [60]

it appears that only one real [61] wife is recognized as legitimate,
but that from "the first times" to the present a man might have as
many concubines as he could secure.

so far as mythology and present day conditions can inform us the bride
has always gone to the home of her husband and, for a time at least,
has been subject to the dictations of her mother-in-law, although the
couple are generally soon established in a home of their own, in the
town of the groom. there is nothing in tinguian life or tradition to
indicate that they have ever had a clan system or a matriarchal form
of government.

the few references to the procedure immediately after a death indicate
that, in part, the people of to-day follow the old custom; but here
again an important departure occurs. we are thrice told that the
corpse was placed on a little raft called tabalang and set adrift
on the river; and in one case the afterbirth was treated in the same
manner. nothing of the sort is done to-day, nor does it seem at all
likely that such has been the case in recent generations. the body
is now buried beneath the house, and certain set rules govern the
movements of all persons related to the deceased, as well as the
disposal of the corpse. this procedure is so complex and so uniform
throughout the whole tinguian belt that it seems improbable that it
has grown up, except through a long period of time. at this point
it is interesting to note that at many ceremonies it is necessary to
construct a small raft called tal-talababong, or talabong, to place
offerings in it, and set it adrift on the stream, in order that any
spirits who have been prevented from attending the ceremony may still
secure their share. [62]

the festivals, the dances, the observances of the proprieties required
by good breeding or custom of to-day, follow closely those given in
the tales. the greatest divergence is in the offering of betel-nuts
and the telling of names, which occupies such an important place in
the narratives. the use of betel-nut for chewing is less common among
the tinguian people than with most other philippine tribes, a fact
which may be accounted for by their constant use of tobacco. however,
betel-nuts still occupy a most important place in the various
ceremonies, and many offerings intended for the spirits must be
accompanied with the prepared nut. in nearly every instance when
invitations were sent out, for a ceremony, the people of the tales
intrusted an oiled betel-nut covered with gold with this duty. this
has its counterpart to-day in the small gifts of gold which are
often carried to some friend, in another town, whose presence is
particularly desired. it seems not improbable that the golden colored
husks of the ripe betel-nuts may have suggested the substitution.

magic was practiced extensively in "the first time," but it is by
no means unknown to the people of the present day. they cannot now
bring a dead person to life, or create human beings out of bits of
betel-nut; but they can and do cause sickness and death to their foes
by performing certain rites or directing actions against garments or
other objects recently in their possession. even the name of an enemy
can be applied to an animal or inanimate object and action against
it be transferred to the owner.

like the tinguian, the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan are warned
or encouraged by omens received through the medium of birds, thunder,
lightning, or the condition of the gall and liver of a slaughtered pig;
[63] and like them they suffer for failure to heed these warnings,
or for the infraction of a taboo.

the myths of the first division make it plain that, to the people of
those times, the sun, moon, and stars were animate--either spirits or
human beings. in some cases a similar conception was held for thunder
and lightning, while in others they appear as animals. it will appear
that such ideas are not foreign to the second division of the tales,
which represent present day beliefs. thus, in the mountain village
of baay the sky is considered as a male spirit--the husband of the
earth, and father of sun and moon. again, in lagangilang and abang,
the thunderbolt is identified as kadaklan--the most powerful of all
spirits--who "often eats the ground and releases his wife agemem."

this brings us to a most interesting question, namely: are the chief
actors in our tales to be considered as celestial beings and spirits,
or as human heroes? we have already made note of the fact that in the
first tale aponitolau is identified with ini-init whom, we are told,
was "the sun," "the man who makes the sun," "a round stone which
rolls." in this tale he marries aponibolinayen, a maiden whose name
may possibly be construed to mean "the woman in the moon." [64]
however, we find aponitolau abandoning his place in the sky and
going to reside in kadalayapan. this tale comes from the town of
langangilang where, as we have already seen, the celestial beings
are regarded as spirits. tale fifteen, coming from the same town,
shows us this same aponitolau going up to the sky, where he marries
the spirit kabkabaga-an, but as before he returns to his home below. a
further indication of his celestial character is perhaps afforded us
in tale fourteen, which was recorded in patok, a valley town in which
the sun, moon, and stars are now regarded as "lights" belonging to
the spirit kadaklan. here we find that aponitolau marries the star
maid gaygayoma, who is the daughter of the big star bagbagak, and
sinag--the moon. in this same tale aponibolinayen appears as the
first wife of aponitolau, and it is clear that in the mind of the
story teller she is not identified with sinag. aponitolau appears in
the other tales without any hint of celestial qualities. aside from
her name and the fact that she is once pictured as visiting the sky,
there is nothing to indicate that his wife aponibolinayen is to be
considered as the moon. a careful study of the other characters who
reside in kadalayapan and kaodanan fails to yield any evidence that
they are considered as celestial beings.

during the sayang ceremony held in san juan, a certain man and woman,
who are then called iwaginan and gimbagon, [65] represent the good
spirits and are defended by the people when evil spirits try to
dispossess them of their property. this is the only instance i have
observed in which the names of any of these characters of the tales
appear in the ceremonies, while a list of more than one hundred and
fifty spirits known to the tinguian fails to reveal more.

while in the practice of magic, and in their communication with nature,
celestial bodies, and spirits, these "people of the first times"
far excelled the present tinguian, they had a material culture and
ceremonial life much like that still found in abra.

it seems then that these people, about whom the stories cluster, are
not to be identified as celestial beings or spirits. [66] they appear
rather as generalized heroes whose life and deeds represent that of
an earlier period, magnified and extolled by succeeding generations.


ritualistic and explanatory myths

the second division of the tales now assumes a position of importance
to us, for in it we find present day ideas and beliefs of the people
strongly brought out, and are thus in a position to contrast them
with the tenets of the people in "the first times."

the influence of custom is exceedingly strong among the tinguian of
to-day. the fact that the ancestors did so and so is sufficient
justification for performing any act for which they have no
definite explanation. nowhere is this influence greater than in the
ceremonies. these, which accompany all the important happenings in
their daily life, are conducted by mediums who are fitted for office
by long training, and each one of whom is a check on the others if
they wilfully or through carelessness deviate from the old forms. the
ritual of these ceremonies is very complex and the reason for doing
many acts now seems to be entirely lost, yet the one explanation
"kadauyan"--custom--is sufficient to satisfy any tinguian. other acts,
as well as the possession of certain things, are explained by myths,
such as we are considering. it seems certain that we are here dealing
not with present day beliefs alone, but with at least relatively old
customs and tales, which while enabling us to understand present day
conceptions also give us a glimpse into the past.

the myths 32-40, which are known to the people as diams, are now
inseparable parts of the various ceremonies. thus, when a pig is to
be offered in the sayang ceremony, the medium sits down beside it and
strokes it with oiled fingers while she "talks to the spirits." the
translation of her "talk" shows that this is in no sense a prayer
but is rather an account of how the greatest of the spirits taught
the tinguian people to perform this ceremony correctly. likewise,
when she offers food in the dawak  [67] ceremony, she relates how the
spirit kaboniyan taught the tinguian to do this in the same manner
that he performs it. in the pala-an [68] diam she relates, in story
form, the cause of the sickness, but in this case ends with a direct
invocation to the spirits in dadaya to "make them well again if you
please." the balance of the diams, 35-40, are in story form, and
seem intended more as an explanation to the people as to the causes
of their troubles than to be directed toward the spirits. however,
the medium seldom has an audience, and rarely ever a single listener,
as she recites the diams she has learned verbatim from her instructors
when preparing for the duties of her office.

myths 41-54 are of quite a different type. they are generally told
by the mediums or wise old people, during the ceremonies, but always
to a crowd of eager listeners. they are not learned word for word, as
are the diams, but their content is constant and they are thoroughly
believed.

that they exert a great influence on the beliefs and conduct of
both old and young is undoubted. the evil which befalls a person who
molests the guardian stones is thus made known even to the children who
generally keep at a distance from the grove in which they stand. again,
these tales give sharp warning as to what befalls a person who even
ignorantly breaks the taboos following a death; but at the same time
advance means of thwarting the wrath of the enraged or evil spirits.

myths 55 to 62 at first glance to not appear to be explanatory
at all, but seem rather to be a series of stories dealing with the
relations between certain persons and the natural spirits or those of
the dead. however, it is the intent and use rather than the form of
these stories which has caused them to be included in this division,
for they give the people authority for certain beliefs and conceptions
which they hold. tale 56 gives us a glimpse of the prevalent idea of
the abode of the dead, where the spirits lead much the same sort of
life as they did while alive, but we secure quite a different picture
of this realm from the baluga  [69] tale, in which the home of the
deceased is said to be in the ground while the "life" of the dead
woman is kept in a bamboo cup. this last account was heard in manabo,
a town near to the igorot settlements of the upit river, and may be
influenced by the beliefs held in that section. [70]

certain individuals appear to have intimate dealings with the natural
spirits, in some instances even being joined to them in marriage. the
afterbirth child, sayen, is believed to have lived "not very long
ago;" yet we find his life and actions quite similar to those of
the heroes in "the first times," while his foster mother--the alan
[71]--takes the same part as did the alan of old.

relations 63 to 74 appear as pure explanatory tales, accounting
for the existence and appearance of celestial bodies and animals in
their present state; they also account for the possession of fire and
of many prized objects, such as jars and agate beads. incidentally
many essential traits and old customs come out, such, for instance,
as those of war and mourning, which appear in connection with the
origin of the kalau. [72]

with few exceptions the myths of this division correspond to present
beliefs; the spirits are those known to-day; the towns mentioned are
now existing or their former locations are well known. they have thus
the appearance of being of more recent origin than those of the first
division, yet it is worthy of note that there is little in them which
seems foreign to or out of keeping with the older tales.


fables

the last division may be said to be made up of fables, for the story
tellers without hesitation label them as fictions. the last of these
appears to be only a worked over incident of myth 56, in which the
big bird banog carries the hero to its nest, from which he escapes
by holding to the wings of the young birds. it is possible that more
of these fables are likewise incidents in tales prevalent among the
tinguian, but not heard by the writer. whether or no this be true, it
is certain that most of these stories are well known to the ilocano
of the coast and the other christianized natives throughout the
archipelago. comparison with the folk-lore from other regions shows
that these stories are by no means confined to the philippines. the
chief incidents in the narrative of the turtle and the monkey have been
recorded from the kenyah of borneo [73] and from the northern peninsula
of celebes; [74] the race between the shell and the carabao is told in
british north borneo [75] in regard to the plandok and crab, while it
is known to european children as the race between the turtle and the
hare. the threat of the mosquito in 84 is almost identical with that
recorded by evans in borneo; [76] while many incidents in the fable
of dogidog [77] are found in the iban story of simpang impang. [78]

when comparing the tinguian versions of these fables with those of the
ilocano, one is impressed with the fact that while the incidents upon
which they are founded are often identical, the stories themselves
have frequently been moulded and changed by the tellers, who have
introduced bits of old customs and beliefs until they reflect, in a
way, the prevalent ideas of the people. thus in the story of the magic
poncho, [79] which is evidently of spanish introduction, the owner
is identified as the banbantay--a well-known minor spirit. again,
the first part of tale 85 is identical with that of the ilocano,
but ends with the parents of the groom preparing the things used in
the pakalon--a very necessary part of the tinguian marriage ceremony.

the footnotes have called attention to the many incidents which have
their parallels in other districts. reference to these shows that
a large percentage are found in the islands toward the south. while
recognizing that similarity of incidents does not necessarily mean
identity of origin, we must still give full credit to the effects
of borrowing, even over great distances. the easy communication
along the coast during the past four hundred years and the contact
with spanish and christianized officials and traders will readily
explain the likeness of the tales in division iii to those held in
distant islands, or even in europe, but, as just noted, these are
now undergoing change. doubtless a similar inflow had been taking
place, although at a slower rate, long before the spaniards reached
the islands, and tinguian mythology has grown up as the result of
blending of native tales with those of other areas, the whole being
worked over and reshaped until it fitted the social setting.

previous writers--among them ratzel and graebner [80]--have sought
to account for certain resemblances in culture, between malaysia,
polynesia, and america, by historical connection. a part of our
material--such as that of the blood-clot child (p. 125), [81] the rape
of the maiden by the vine which carries her to the sky (p. 33), [82]
the magic flight (p. 75), [83] and magic growth (p. 38) [84]--may seem
to lend support to such a theory. these similarities are assuredly
suggestive and interesting, but it appears to the writer that the
material is too scanty and the folklore of intervening lands too
little known to justify us in considering them as convincing proof
of borrowing over such immense distances. [85]



general results

our study has brought out certain general results. we have seen
that tinguian folklore has much in common with that of other tribes
and lands. while a part of this similarity is doubtless due to
borrowing--a process which can still be seen at work--a considerable
portion of the tales is probably of local and fairly recent origin,
while the balance appears to be very old. these older tales are so
intimately interwoven with the ceremonies, beliefs, and culture of this
people that they may safely be considered as having been developed by
them. they are doubtless much influenced by present day conditions,
for each story teller must, even unconsciously, read into them some
of his own experiences and the current beliefs of the tribe. at the
same time these traditional accounts doubtless exercise a potent
influence on the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of the people. in
tinguian society, where custom still holds undisputed sway, these
well-known tales of past times must tend to cast into the same mould
any new facts or experiences which come to them.

we believe that we are justified when we take the viewpoint of
the tinguian and consider "the stories of the first times" as
essentially very old. how old it is impossible to state definitely,
but a careful analysis of our material justifies us in believing that
they reflect a time before the people possessed terraced rice fields,
when domestic work animals were still unknown, and the horse had not
yet been introduced into their land. that these are not recent events
is attested by the great part they all now play in the ceremonial
and economic life. it is evident that outside influences of great
importance were introduced at a period later than the time when the
chinese first began to trade along the coasts of the philippines for
the prized jars, which play such an important role in the mythology,
are not to be identified as those of native make but are ancient
chinese vessels dating back at least to the fourteenth and perhaps
even to the tenth century. [86]

it is probable that the glass, porcelain, and agate beads, which
are second only to the jars in importance, are exceedingly old. many
ancient specimens are still in use and are held for as fabulous prices
as are those found among the interior tribes of borneo. nieuwenhuis
has shown that the manufacture of beads had become a great industry
in the middle ages, and had extended even to china and japan, whence
the products may have spread contemporaneously with the pottery. [87]

we have seen that, for the most part, the life, customs, and beliefs
which appear in our reconstruction of "the first times" agrees
closely with present conditions; certain things which seem formerly
to have been of prime importance--such as the sending of a betel-nut
covered with gold to invite guests to a festival or ceremony--appear
to have their echo in present conditions. the betel-nut which played
such a momentous part in the old times still holds its place in the
rituals of the many ceremonies, although it is not now much used in
daily life. the magic of to-day is less powerful than formerly, but is
still a tremendous force. the communication of the ancient people with
other members of the animate world, as well as with the inanimate and
spiritual, and their metamorphosis into animals and the like, offers
nothing strange or inconsistent to the people of to-day. they even now
talk to jars, they converse with spirits who come to them through the
bodies of their mediums, and people only recently deceased are known to
have had the power of changing themselves, at will, into other forms.

in short, there is no sharp break between the mode of thought of to-day
and that exhibited in the folklore. it is true that the tales give
sanction to some things not in agreement with tinguian usage--such,
for instance, as the marriage of relatives, or the method of disposing
of the dead--and it may be that we have here a remembrance of customs
which long ago fell into disuse.

in a previous paper  [88] the writer showed that there have been many
migrations into abra from the north, south, and west. a part of the
emigrants have become thoroughly amalgamated with the tinguian people
and have doubtless introduced some part of their material culture
and beliefs. this helps us to understand such conflicts as we have
already noted in regard to the place held by thunder and lightning
in the spirit world, as to the future abode of the spirits of the
departed, as well as other discrepancies which the limits of this
paper have prevented us from discussing.

it is not impossible that those customs of "the first times," which
are at variance with those of to-day, may represent older ideas which
have been swamped, or, on the other hand, the memory of the strange
customs once practiced by the emigrants may have caused them to be
attributed to the people of the tales.

finally, we believe that a study of tinguian mythology has shown us
that we can gain a real knowledge of the past of a people through
their folklore; that we can secure an insight into their mental life;
and can learn something of the valuation they attach to certain of
their activities and beliefs, which to us may seem at the surface
trite and trivial.
