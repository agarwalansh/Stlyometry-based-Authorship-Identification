    "on the whole this was surely the mightiest genius since milton. in
    poetry there is not his like, when he rose to his full power; he was
    a philosopher, the immensity of whose mind cannot be gauged by
    anything he has left behind; a critic, the subtlest and most
    profound of his time. yet these vast and varied powers flowed away
    in the shifting sands of talk; and what remains is but what the few
    land-locked pools are to the receding ocean which has left them
    casually behind without sensible diminution of its
    waters."

preface

the work known as the biographical supplement of the biographia
literaria of s. t. coleridge, and published with the latter in 1847, was
begun by henry nelson coleridge, and finished after his death by his
widow, sara coleridge. the first part, concluding with a letter dated
5th november 1796, is the more valuable portion of the biographical
supplement. what follows, written by sara coleridge, is more
controversial than biographical and does not continue, like the first
part, to make coleridge tell his own life by inserting letters in the
narrative. of 33 letters quoted in the whole work, 30 are contained in
the section written by henry nelson coleridge. of these 11 were drawn
from cottle's early recollections, seven being letters to josiah wade,
four to joseph cottle, and the remainder are sixteen letters to poole,
one to benjamin flower, one to charles e heath, and one to henry martin.

from this i think it is evident that henry nelson coleridge intended
what was published as a supplement to the biographia literaria to be a
life of coleridge, either supplementary to the biographia literaria or
as an independent narrative, in which most of the letters published by
cottle in 1837 and unpublished letters to poole and other correspondents
were to form the chief material. sara coleridge, in finishing the
fragment, did not attempt to carry out the original intention of her
husband. a few letters in cottle were perhaps not acceptable to her
taste, and in rejecting them she perhaps resolved to reject all
remaining letters in cottle. she thus finished the fragmentary life of
coleridge left by her husband in her own way.

but henry nelson coleridge had begun to build on another plan. his
intention was simply to string all coleridge's letters available on a
slim biographical thread and thus produce a work in which the poet would
have been made to tell his own life. his beginning with the five
biographical letters to thomas poole is a proof of this. he took these
as his starting point; and, as far as he went, his "life of coleridge"
thus constructed is the most reliable of all the early biographies of
coleridge.

this edition of the biographical supplement is meant to carry out as far
as possible the original project of its author. the whole of his
narrative has been retained, and also what sara coleridge added to his
writing; and all the non-copyright letters of coleridge available from
other sources have been inserted into the narrative, and additional
biographical matter, explanatory of the letters, has been given. [1] by
this retention of authentic sources i have produced as faithful a
picture of the poet-philosopher coleridge as can be got anywhere, for
coleridge always paints his own character in his letters. those desirous
of a fuller picture may peruse, along with this work, the letters
published in the collection of 1895, the place of which in the narrative
is indicated in footnotes.

the letters of coleridge have slowly come to light. coleridge was always
fond of letter-writing, and at several periods of his career he was more
active in letter-writing than at others. he commenced the publication of
his letters himself. the epistolary form was as dear to him in prose as
the ballad or odic form in verse. from his earliest publications we can
see he loved to launch a poem with "a letter to the editor," or to the
recipient, as preface. the "mathematical problem", one of his juvenile
facetiae in rhyme, was thus heralded with a letter addressed to his
brother george explaining the import of the doggerel. his first printed
poem, "to fortune" (dykes campbell's edition of the "poems", p. 27), was
also prefaced by a short letter to the editor of the "morning
chronicle". among coleridge's letters are several of this sort, and each
affords a glimpse into his character. those with the "raven" and
"talleyrand to lord grenville" are characteristic specimens of his
drollery and irony.

coleridge's greatest triumphs in letter-writing were gained in the field
of politics. his two letters to fox, his letters on the spaniards, and
those to judge fletcher, are his highest specimens of epistolary
eloquence, and constitute him the rival of rousseau as an advocate of
some great truth in a letter addressed to a public personage. in
clearness of thought and virile precision of language they surpass the
most of anything that coleridge has written. they never wander from the
point at issue; the evolution of their ideas is perfect, their idiom the
purest mother-english written since the refined vocabulary of hooker,
jeremy taylor, and harrington was coined.

besides the political letters, coleridge published during his lifetime
four important letters of great length written during his sojourn in
germany. three of these appeared in the "friend" of 1809, and indeed
were the finest part of that periodical; and one was first made public
in the "amulet" of 1829. six letters published in "blackwood's magazine"
of 1820-21, and a few others of less importance, brought up the number
of letters published by coleridge to 46. the following is a list of them:

besides these there are privately printed letters and letters not yet
published to be taken account of. the chief collection of these is
"letters from the lake poets" (edited by e. h. coleridge), containing 87
letters to daniel stuart, some of which are republished in the
"letters", 1895. the remainder of letters not published, from the
information given by mr. e. h. coleridge in his preface, i make out to
be about 300.

nor does this exhaust the list of letters written by coleridge. in
ainger's collection of the letters of charles lamb are 62 letters by
lamb to coleridge, most of which are in answer to letters received. we
may therefore estimate the letters of coleridge to lamb at not less than
62. in dorothy wordsworth's "grasmere journal" there are no less than 32
letters to the wordsworths[1] mentioned as having been received during
the period 1800-1803, not represented among the letters in professor
knight's "life of wordsworth". the total number of letters known to have
been written by coleridge is therefore between 1,100 and 1,200. other
correspondents of coleridge not appearing among the recipients of
letters in publications are probably as follows:

v. le grice.

sam. le grice.

t. f. middleton.

robert allen.

robert lovell.

ch. lloyd, jr.

mrs. clarkson (except one small fragment in "diary of h. c. robinson").

the letters of coleridge, taken as a whole, are one of the most
important contributions to english letter-writing. they are gradually
coming to light, and with every letter or group of letters put forth,
the character and intellectual development of coleridge is becoming
clearer. his poems and prose works, great as these are, are not
comprehensible without a study of his letters, which join together the
"insulated fragments" of that grand scheme of truth which he called his
"system" ("table talk", 12th sept. 1831, and 26th june 1834).
coleridge, in his letters, has written his own life, for his life, after
all, was a life of thought, and his finest thoughts and his most
ambitious aspirations are given expression to in his letters to his
numerous friends; and the true biography of coleridge is that in which
his letters are made the main source of the narrative. a biographia
epistolaris is what we want of such a man.

coleridge's letters are often bizarre in construction and quite
regardless of the conventions of style, and abound in the most curious
freaks of emphasis and imagery. they resemble the letters of cowper in
that they were not written for publication; and, like cowper's, they
have a character of their own. but they far surpass the epistles of the
poet of olney in spiritual vision and intellectuality. the eighteenth
century, from pope and swift down to cowper, is extremely
 rich in
letter-writing. bolingbroke, lord chesterfield, lady mary wortley
montagu, gray, mason, johnson, beattie, burns, and gibbon, among
literary personages, have contributed to the great epistolick art, as
dr. johnson called it; and this list does not include the letters of the
politicians, horace walpole, junius, and others. the eighteenth century,
in fact, was a letter-writing age; and while the bulk of the poetry of
its 300 poets, with the exception of a few masterpieces of monumental
quality, has gradually gone out of fashion, its letters have risen into
greater repute. even among the poets whose verse is still read there is
a hesitation in public opinion as to whether the verses or letters are
superior. there are readers not a few who would not scruple to place
cowper's letters above his poems, who believe that gray's letters are
much more akin to the modern spirit than the "elegy" and the "ode
to eton college", and who think that swift's fly-leaves to his
friends will outlive the fame of "gulliver" and the "tale of a
tub".

coleridge, who stands between the eighteenth and the nineteenth
centuries, was, like the poets of the former age, a multiform
letter-writer. he was often seized with letter-writing when unable to
write poetry or execute those unpublished masterpieces in the
composition of some of which he was engaged.

coleridge's letters are of the utmost importance as a part of the
literature of the opening of the nineteenth century. it is in the
letters that we see better than elsewhere the germs of the speculations
which afterwards came to fruition between 1817 and 1850, when the
poetical and critical principles of the lake school gradually took the
place of the classicism of the eighteenth century, and the theology of
broad churchism began to displace the old theology, and the school of
paley in evidences and locke in philosophy gave way before the inroad of
transcendentalism.

as the record of the phases of an intellectual development the letters
of coleridge stand very high; and, indeed, i do not know anything equal
to them except it be the "journal of amiel".

the resemblance between coleridge and amiel is very striking. both
valetudinarians and barely understood by the friends with whom they came
into contact, they took refuge in the inner shrine of introspection, and
clothed the most abstruse ideas in the most beautiful forms of language
and imagery that is only not poetry because it is not verse. while one
wrote the story of his own intellectual development in secret and
retained the record of it hidden from all eyes, the other scattered his
to the winds in the shape of letters, which thus, widely distributed,
kept his secret until they were gathered together by later hands. the
letters of coleridge as a collection is one of the most engaging
psychological studies of the history of an individual mind.

the text of the letters in the present volume is reproduced from the
original sources, the "biographical supplement", cottle, gillman,
allsop, and the "life and correspondence of robert southey". fuller
texts of some of the letters will be found in "letters of s. t. c." of
1895, litchfield's "tom wedgwood", and other recent publications. one of
the objects of the present work is to preserve the text of the letters
as presented in these authentic sources of the life of coleridge.

letters nos. 44, 45, and 46, from "charles lamb and the lloyds", by mr.
e. v. lucas (smith, elder and co.); no. 130 from "anima poetae" (w.
heinemann), are printed here by arrangement with the poet's grandson,
ernest hartley coleridge, esq., to whom my sincere thanks are also due
for his kindness in reading the proofs. mr. coleridge, of course, is not
responsible for any of the opinions expressed in this work; but he has
taken great pains in putting me right regarding certain views of others
who had written on coleridge, and also on some of the mistakes made by
henry nelson coleridge and sara coleridge, who had insufficient data on
the matters on which they wrote, and definite information on which,
indeed, could not be ascertainable in 1847. coming from mr.
coleridge--the chief living authority on the life, letters, and
published and unpublished writings of s. t. coleridge--the corrections
in the footnotes and elsewhere may be taken as authoritative; and i have
to acknowledge my indebtedness to him accordingly,
