british isles, france, germany, spain, belgium, the netherlands and
italy, the consideration being a figure less than that representing the
value of a single square block in any one of our great cities, or an
amount much smaller than has been yielded by any one of many mines
within the boundaries of the territory. twelve flourishing states and
two territories have since been carved out of louisiana, and the center
of our population is rapidly moving towards that region which was once
known as the wilderness of the west.


robert r. livingston

it is a matter of the utmost gratification that the state of new york
played so important a part in this great event in the person of robert
r. livingston, who was then united states minister to france. dr.
livingston, the title of ll.d. having been conferred upon him by the
university of the state of new york, was one of the leading statesmen of
his day. a graduate of kings (now columbia) college, he began his career
in the practice of law in new york city, and was made recorder of the
city in 1773. elected to the continental congress in 1775, he was
appointed one of a committee of five to draft the declaration of
independence, but enforced absence from philadelphia made it impossible
for him to sign the document. he was soon after elected chancellor of
the state of new york, and as such administered the oath of office to
george washington as first president of the united states. his previous
training in public affairs admirably fitted him for assuming the
important duties leading to the transfer of the louisiana territory, and
to him as much as to any individual belongs the credit for the
successful consummation of the transaction.

at the exposition a handsome statue of livingston, by lukemann, was
erected in the cascade gardens, on the approach to the west pavilion.
upon the front of the new york state building appeared this legend:
"robert r. livingston of new york, minister to france 1801-1805,
inaugurated the negotiations for the louisiana purchase and was the
first to sign the treaty."


origin of the exposition

the first action looking towards the commemoration of the louisiana
purchase was taken at a meeting of the missouri historical society in
september, 1898, when a committee of fifty citizens was appointed to
take the preliminary steps looking to the observance of the occasion.
this committee recommended the submission of the question to a
convention of delegates, representing all the louisiana purchase states,
and at this convention, which was held at the southern hotel, st. louis,
january 10, 1899, it was decided to hold a world's fair as the most
fitting commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the
acquisition of the louisiana territory. an executive committee, with the
hon. david r. francis as chairman, was appointed to carry out the
undertaking, and this committee determined that at least $15,000,000,
the amount paid to france for the territory, would be needed.


action by congress

congress passed a bill in june, 1900, carrying a provisional
appropriation of $5,000,000, and pledging governmental support if the
city of st. louis raised $10,000,000. the people went to work with a
will and had raised $5,000,000 by popular subscription early in january,
1901, and the following january thirtieth an ordinance was passed by the
st. louis municipal assembly authorizing the issuance of $5,000,000 in
city bonds. on march twelfth president mckinley appointed a national
commission of nine members, and in august issued a proclamation inviting
all the nations of the world to participate in the exposition. owing to
labor difficulties and delay in securing construction material it soon
became evident that it would be impossible to hold the fair during the
year 1903, as originally planned. legislation being necessary in order
to provide for the necessary postponement, a bill was passed by congress
and approved by president roosevelt june 25, 1902, authorizing the
holding of the fair in 1904 instead of 1903, as originally determined.

beginning with the basic appropriation of $15,000,000, [footnote: in the
winter of 1904 a bill was passed by congress authorizing a government
loan of $4,600,000 to the exposition company, to be repaid in
instalments from the gate receipts.  the loan was entirely canceled
early in november, 1904.] as described above, to which had been added
$1,000,000 appropriated by the state of missouri, the great enterprise
was projected on a $50,000,000 basis. it was planned to make the
universal exposition at st. louis the most comprehensive and wonderful
that the world had ever seen. how well its projectors succeeded is a
matter of recent history. how completely all previous expositions were
eclipsed has been told many times in picture and in print.


the site

the site chosen for the exposition included the western portion of
forest park, one of the finest parks in the united states. its naturally
rolling ground afforded many opportunities for effective vistas, which
were quickly embraced by the exposition company's landscape artists.
containing 1,240 acres, it was a tract approximately two miles long and
one mile wide.

the grounds might be said to have been divided into two general
sections, the dividing line being skinker road. to the east was the main
picture, so called, which was formed by the grouping of eight
magnificent exhibit palaces around festival hall, the colonnade of
states and cascade gardens.


the main picture

festival hall stood upon a rise of ground well above the principal
exhibit palaces, and its majestic dome surmounted by a gilded figure of
"victory," the first "victory" to take the form of a man, was visible
from most any part of the grounds. the grouping of the exhibit palaces
was geometric in arrangement, in shape like an open fan, the ribs of the
fan being the waterways and plazas between which the exhibit palaces
were located.


the architecture

the architecture, while varied and in some instances striking, was still
so modified as to make a most harmonious whole. for purity in
architecture the best example was the palace of education, which was
built on the lines of the italian renaissance. for most striking
architectural effects the mines and metallurgy building was invariably
pointed out. it was of composite architecture, comprising features of
the egyptian, byzantine and greek. the stately obelisks which guarded
its entrance ways and the bas-relief panels which formed its outer
facade, were objects of universal interest.

to the southeast of the main group of buildings, and gracefully
clustered among the trees, were the state pavilions. along the extreme
northern portion of the grounds for a mile stretched the amusement
highway, known as the pike.


other features

to the west of skinker road were located the administration buildings,
and, with one or two exceptions, the pavilions of foreign governments,
the agriculture and horticulture buildings, the philippine reservation
and the department of anthropology. the intramural railroad, seven miles
in length, passed the principal points of interest and enabled visitors
to get about the grounds with speed and comfort.

to convert this great tract of land into a beautiful park with well-kept
roadways embellished with velvety lawns and magnificent flower beds,
would seem to be a task greater than man could perform within the short
space of time available for the completion of the exposition. that it
was done, and well done, is a matter of history.


processes as well as products

it was early determined that the great fair should be one of processes,
as well as of products; wherever possible there should be life and
motion; that the exhibits should answer the question, "how is it done?"
as well as "what is it?" the result was that the exposition became a
constantly changing scene of moving objects and an educational force
many times greater than any of its predecessors. the student of
mechanics, electricity, pedagogy, the applied arts, and other kindred
subjects could obtain here within a limited area valuable data, which
otherwise could only be collected at the expense of much time and
considerable money.


dedication ceremonies

the formal dedication ceremonies covered three days, beginning april 30,
1903, the actual date of the centennial anniversary of the signing of
the treaty, and one year previous to the opening of the exposition. our
commonwealth was fittingly represented at that time, a special
appropriation of $50,000 for the same having been made by the
legislature. governor odell and staff, state officers, a joint committee
from the legislature and the members of the louisiana purchase
exposition commission attended. there were also present a provisional
regiment of infantry of the national guard, under command of colonel s.
m. welch, n.g., n.y.; a provisional division of the naval militia under
command of lieutenant e.m. harman, second battalion; and squadron "a" of
new york, under command of major oliver h. bridgman.


the first day's program

the program for the first day consisted of a grand military parade in
the morning and exercises in the liberal arts building at two o'clock in
the afternoon, followed by fireworks in the evening. the day was cold
and unpleasant, and a chill wind blowing from the north caused visitors
to seek comfort in heavy wraps.

the governor of the state of new york and her troops met with a
continuous ovation along the line of march of the great military parade,
and from every side compliments and felicitations were bestowed upon the
state's representatives for so hearty and imposing a participation in an
event a thousand miles from home.

the occasion was graced by the presence of the president of the united
states, theodore roosevelt, and by ex-president grover cleveland, both
of whom made extended remarks at the afternoon exercises.


address of president roosevelt.

the address of president roosevelt was replete with historical allusions
and pointed epigrams. he drew many lessons from the valor and patriotism
of the early settlers of the west, and said, among other things:

"courage and hardihood are indispensable virtues in a people; but the
people which possesses no others can never rise high in the scale either
of power or of culture. great peoples must have in addition the
governmental capacity which comes only when individuals fully recognize
their duties to one another and to the whole body politic, and are able
to join together in feats of constructive statesmanship and of honest
and effective administration. ... we justly pride ourselves on our
marvelous material prosperity, and such prosperity must exist in order
to establish a foundation upon which a higher life can be built; but
unless we do in very fact build this higher life thereon, the material
prosperity itself will go for but very little. ... the old days were
great because the men who lived in them had mighty qualities; and we
must make the new days great by showing these same qualities. we must
insist upon courage and resolution, upon hardihood, tenacity, and
fertility of resource; we must insist upon the strong, virile virtues;
and we must insist no less upon the virtues of self-restraint,
self-mastery, regard for the rights of others; we must show our
abhorrence of cruelty, brutality, and corruption, in public and in
private life alike."


address of ex-president cleveland

ex president cleveland delivered an eloquent panegyric and in closing
said:

"... we may well recall in these surroundings the wonderful measure of
prophecy's fulfillment, within the span of a short century, the spirit,
the patriotism and the civic virtue of americans who lived a hundred
years ago, and god's overruling of the wrath of man, and his devious
ways for the blessing of our nation. we are all proud of our american
citizenship. let us leave this place with this feeling stimulated by the
sentiments born of the occasion. let us appreciate more keenly than ever
how vitally necessary it is to our country's wealth that every one
within its citizenship should be clean minded in political aim and
aspiration, sincere and honest in his conception of our country's
mission, and aroused to higher and more responsive patriotism by the
reflection that it is a solemn thing to belong to a people favored of
god."


the second day's program

the second day was designated "diplomatic day," and was devoted to a
luncheon to the visiting diplomats in the administration building,
followed by exercises in festival hall, at which time addresses were
made by honorable john m. thurston of the national commission, who was
president of the day; honorable david r. francis, president of the
exposition company; m. jean j. jusserand, the french ambassador, and
senor don emilio de ojeda, the spanish minister. in the evening a
brilliant reception was given to the diplomatic corps at the st. louis
club.


the third day's program

the third day, saturday, may second, was officially designated "state
day," and the exercises consisted of a huge civic parade, which consumed
two hours in passing a given point, and exercises at two o'clock in the
liberal arts building, over which ex-senator william lindsay of the
national commission presided. addresses were made by governor dockery,
who welcomed the governors and delegations from the various states and
by governor odell of new york, who responded. his brilliant address,
which was frequently punctuated by applause, follows:


address of governor odell

"_governor dockery, ladies and gentlemen:_

"there is no phase of american history which should inspire us with
greater pride than the consummation of the purchase of the louisiana
tract, an event which opened the pathway to the west, and made possible
the powerful nation to which we owe our allegiance. trade, the
inspiration for travel, which brought about the discovery and
civilization of the western hemisphere, would have demanded inevitably
the cession to the united states of the vast regions beyond the
mississippi. except, however, for the peaceful and diplomatic measures
adopted through the wisdom of thomas jefferson, this territory could
only have been acquired by the sacrifice of human life and the
expenditure of untold treasure. that robert livingston, a citizen of the
empire state, became the ambassador of the great commoner at the court
of france and that it was due to his skill and intelligence that
napoleon was brought to an understanding of the conditions as they
existed and of the determination of our then young republic to prevent
the building up of foreign colonies at our very threshold, is a cause
for congratulation to the people of the state i represent, and renders
the duty which has been assigned to me, therefore, doubly pleasant.
memorable as was this event, and of great importance to the future
growth of the republic, it left its imprint not only upon america, but
upon europe as well. through it the napoleonic ambition to develop a
vast plan of colonization which threatened the peace of the world was
thwarted. the dismemberment of the french possessions which soon
followed resulted in the grouping together of the various states of
europe into vast empires whose relations with our country are such that
encroachment or territorial aggrandizement upon this hemisphere are
forever impossible. spain, whose waning power was then apparent, was no
longer a menace, and thus rendered possible the acquisition of the
remaining stretch of territory which made our possessions secure from
the gulf to the canadian line. while, therefore, as americans we are
prone to the belief that if the necessity had arisen we should have been
able to wrest this rich and fertile territory from even the strongest
hands, it is well for us to understand, however, that even the diplomacy
of which we boast would have been futile except for the failure of
napoleon in san domingo and his pressing need of funds to permit him to
face the enemies of the french. 'westward ho!' was the cry of the old
world. from the time when the genius of columbus accepted the theories
of the earlier astronomers the imagination and cupidity of adventurous
spirits had been excited by tales of 'far off cathay.' one hundred years
ago the protocol for this territory was signed; one hundred years of
history has been written; a nation of three millions has expanded into
an empire of eighty millions of souls. our country has not only become a
power among the nations of the world, but has taken an advanced position
in the progress and work of civilization. a westward passage to india
was sought by columbus and was still the aim of la salle in his
adventurous voyage along the mighty mississippi. to-day the american
flag floats at the very gates of china, and almost in sight of its
walls, placed there by american valor and by american arms in a struggle
for human rights, and liberty. trackless forests and undulating prairies
have become the highways for the speeding engines bearing the burdens of
traffic to the orient. no longer are they the pasturage for the buffalo,
but the source of food supply for the whole world. treasures of untold
value have been laid bare by the ingenuity of man, but far beyond this
wealth are the products in grain and lowing kine which add their
hundreds of millions to the resources of our country, extending even
beyond the dreams or the imagination of those who sought only the
precious metals with which to return with a competence to their native
land.

"this is but the span of a century and to commemorate its glories we
come from the eastern section, from the earlier colonies to congratulate
the people of the west upon the results which we as a nation have
achieved. so few the years, yet how notable the history. upon this soil
began those battles which ended in the emancipation of the slave. from
this border, and almost from within this territory, came the great
emancipator, a man who struggled with the vicissitudes of fortune in
early life, who aided in developing the great west, and whose name will
be forever enshrined as the one who in his act as chief magistrate of
this country removed the stain which the earlier dutch had fastened upon
our body politic like a 'festering sore.' the past, with all of its
achievements, with all of its successes, is to us but an incentive and
guide for the future progress of our country. america still beckons to
the oppressed of all lands and holds out the gifts of freedom, and we at
this time, and upon this occasion, should renew our adherence to those
policies which have made us great as a nation. the future is before us,
and the patriotism and self-sacrifice of those who made the country's
history so glorious should be an inspiration to us all for higher ideals
of citizenship. through the golden gates of commerce pours an unceasing
stream of immigration, which must be amalgamated with american ideas and
american principles. from the earlier settlers has come a blending of
the vigor of the anglo-saxon with the teutonic and latin races,
resulting in that composite type which we are wont to recognize and
regard as the type of the true american. aside from the commercial and
industrial results which followed the acquisition of this vast and
fertile territory, and the building up of the large marts and towns
which everywhere blend with its magnificent scenery, the definition of
the power and extent of our constitution was most important. at its
inception, coming at a time when the framers of the constitution were
not only able to interpret their work, but to give to it their moral
force and support, it was demonstrated that no constitutional
limitations should retard the onward growth, the onward rush of american
civilization, until it should have reached the farthermost bounds of the
far-off pacific. the barriers to human progress were by this
interpretation removed and ranges of new states have given effect to the
democratic principles of our great republic, and have made of our
country a union--not of weak, impotent states--but a commonwealth of
nations, bound to each other through a centralized government by ties of
allegiance, common interest and patriotism, where freemen rule and where
suffrage is more esteemed than wealth.

"these rights and their protection should receive our earnest thought.
the battles of the past have been for freedom and liberty, and the
struggles of the future will be for their preservation, not, however, by
force of arms, but through the peaceful methods which come through the
education of our people. the declaration which brought our republic into
existence has insured and guaranteed that liberty of conscience and that
freedom of action which does not interfere with the prerogatives or
privileges of a man's neighbors. capital and labor are the two great
elements upon which the prosperity and happiness of our people rest, and
when, therefore, aggregations of the one are met by combinations of the
other, it should be the aim of all to prevent the clashing of these
great interests. the products of toil are worthless unless there be some
means by which they can be substituted or transferred for that which
labor requires. the concrete form in which these transactions are
conducted is the money power or the capital of the land. without work
all of these fertile fields, these teeming towns, would have been
impossible, and without a desire to benefit and elevate humanity, its
onward progress would have been useless. to work, to labor, is man's
bounden duty, and in the performance of the tasks which have been placed
upon him, he should be encouraged, and his greatest incentive should be
the knowledge that he may transmit to his children and his children's
children a higher civilization and greater advantages than he himself
possessed. trade conditions which would permit to the toiler but a bare
sustenance, the bare means of a livelihood, would be a hindrance to
human progress, a hindrance not to be removed by all of the maxims of
the philosopher or the theories of the doctrinaire. promise without
fulfillment is barren, but when you can place before the mechanic the
assured fact that the performance of his duty means success in life, and
that his non-performance means failure; when you can show him that this
law is immutable, you have made of him a useful citizen and have
instilled into his mind a firm belief that the freedom and liberty of
which we boast is not an inchoate substance to be dreamed of and not
enjoyed. but this desired result cannot be secured if combinations of
capital, which produce the necessaries of life cheaper and better, are
assailed as the enemies of mankind. there is always a mean between those
who seek only a fair recompense and return for that which they produce,
and those who seek undue advantages for the few at the expense of the
many. the laws which have been enacted, if properly executed, are
sufficient in their force and effect to encourage the one and to punish
the other, but in our condemnation let us not forget that with the
expansion that has come to our country, an expansion of our business
relations is also necessary. this growth has brought us into intimate
contact with the markets of the world, and in the struggle that is
always before us, the competition of trade, if we are to hold our own
among the world's producers, we should encourage and not hinder those
who by their energy, their capital and their labor have banded together
for the purpose of meeting these new conditions--problems which our
individual efforts alone cannot solve, but which require the
concentrated force and genius of both capital and labor. incentive for
good citizenship would indeed be lacking if there were taken from us the
opportunities for development, the opportunities for the young man to
follow in the footsteps of those who have written their names in the
history of our country as the great captains of industry. success will
always follow perseverance and genius. every heresy, every doctrine
which would teach the young man of this country differently, is an
insult to the intelligence of our people, and is in the direction of
building up a dangerous element in american society which in time would
threaten not only the peace and prosperity we enjoy, but our very
institutions themselves. when you have placed before the young man all
of his possibilities, you have made it impossible to make of our
republic a plutocracy controlled by the few at the expense of the many.
the individual should count for as much as the aggregation of
individuals, because an injury to the one will lead to the destruction
of the many. the question of adjusting and harmonizing the relations of
capital and labor is the problem before us to-day and is one which will
become more urgent in the future. its solution must be along those lines
of constitutional right which every citizen has been guaranteed. every
man is entitled in the prosecution of his work to the broadest possible
liberty of action and the protection of law, of that law which is the
outgrowth of necessity and which seeks to encourage and not to oppress.
such recognition can always be secured if there is a determination upon
the part of those charged with the responsibility of government to have
it. and who is not? every man possessed of a ballot is responsible and
has the power, not only to formulate but to criticise and to punish as
well. if this right be properly exercised, an honest and efficient
administration of our affairs can always be secured. to aid in this work
we have given to the press the broadest possible liberty, a freedom
which, however, should never be abused. it should never be used as the
medium for the circulation of charges or of calumnies which are without
foundation, and which please but the fancies of those in whose minds
there always exists envy and discontent. such a misuse of privileges
should be condemned by all right-minded citizens. in its virtuous
indignation with those who abuse public place and power, it should be
careful to do exact justice because in our busy and active lives we have
come to depend to a very great extent upon the wisdom and the honesty of
these who edit our newspapers for the information rightly to judge of
the conditions, events and necessities of our country. by means of the
press, and with an intelligent citizenship, we may always feel sure that
there will come into our public life influences for good which will
render our government more stable, will add to its renown and to its
glory and will insure for all the perpetuation of those principles which
have come down to us through the wisdom of our forefathers and which
have been amplified by the knowledge of succeeding generations.

"the greatest solvent for political heresies, for doctrines which are
antagonistic to popular government, is education. to the educated mind
there comes a conception of duty which is not possible to the ignorant.
the great colleges and schools with which we are blessed are performing
a vital work, and these institutions for developing a higher order of
citizenship are of far more worth and of greater importance than all of
the ships of war or the arms of the nation in maintaining and upholding
those policies which have been adopted for our protection against
foreign and domestic foes. but it is not alone a theoretical education
which is necessary for this higher citizenship. it must be linked with
the knowledge which comes of the study of the character, of the manner
and methods of other nations than our own, which leads the artisan to
inspect and to improve upon the ingenuity of his fellows of other lands.
it is this feature in the exposition which is to take place upon this
ground next year that is particularly significant and important in the
solution of the problems to which i have referred. it is the contact,
the friendly rivalry thus created, which brings about a betterment and
improvement of conditions. it is appropriate, therefore, that at the one
hundredth anniversary of this great event of our nation's history, we
should gather here all of the ingenuity and the genius of the past and
the present, that we may contrast and make note of our progress. this
will be an inspiration for us in the performance of our duty, and will
add to our affection for our native and adopted land, and thus make of
america a still greater power for good. a patriotic people is possible
only when there exists a love of country which has been inspired by the
stories of the past. it is the stories of the glorious past which
encourage us to grapple with the problems of the present and to look
with disdain upon those who fail to solve them. what fills our mind with
more gratitude; what inspires us with greater heroism; what instills
more patriotism than the struggles of the early colonial wars? the
anglo-saxon energy which swept from this continent the dominion of those
who sought only wealth, and which substituted the thrift of the voyagers
of the _mayflower_ and of the settlers of jamestown--which speaks
of the battles with the indians, which tells of the glories not only of
victories but of the defeats of the heroes of the revolution--all are
incentives for purer and better citizenship. and so, too, as we recall
the struggles to the death of the descendants of these earlier settlers
in the greatest civil war that the world has ever known, let us to-day,
both in charity and in patriotism, remember them all as heroes. while we
may differ as to the principles for which they fought, there is no
conflict of opinion, no divergence in thought, which bids us to-day to
withhold our admiration for all those who took part in that great
struggle. it was but a page in our nation's history, but a page shaded
by human blood. it was but the working out the will of divine
providence, so that from its baptism of blood our republic might emerge
greater, stronger and more powerful than ever before, that there might
thereafter be no sectional hate, no dividing line in the patriotism of
our people. this it is which should inspire us to-day. more progress, a
further advance in civilization, the extending of a helping hand to the
afflicted and the welcoming word to the oppressed, should be concrete
evidence of america's greatness and of the devotion of her people. then
it will be that our flag, now honored and respected, honored because of
the power and the intelligence of our people, will take on additional
lustre and additional significance as that of a nation that has accepted
its duty to protect humanity at home and abroad, and to stand as the
pacificator and preserver of the peace of the world."

at the conclusion of the afternoon exercises governor odell reviewed the
new york state troops on the plaza in forest park. the review was held
in the presence of a large assemblage and was an inspiring sight.


opening day

one year later, on april 30, 1904, the exposition was formally opened to
the public; elaborate exercises being held at eleven o'clock at the foot
of the louisiana purchase monument on the plaza st. louis. there were
present a distinguished assemblage, including a delegation of the senate
and the house of representatives, the national commission, the board of
lady managers, representatives of foreign governments, governors of
states and their staffs, state commissions, united states government
board, exposition officials, and others. the exercises were opened by a
prayer by rev. frank w. gunsaulus of chicago, which was followed by an
address by president francis. the treasurer of the exposition, william
h. thompson, as chairman of the committee on grounds and buildings,
introduced isaac s. taylor, who delivered the gold key to the buildings
to president francis and presented diplomas to his staff. an address
followed by director of exhibits f.j.v. skiff, who presented commissions
to his staff, the chiefs of the various exhibit departments. next
followed addresses in behalf of the city of st. louis by hon. rolla
wells, mayor; in behalf of the national commission by hon. thomas h.
carter, its president; in behalf of the united states senate by senator
henry e. burnham; in behalf of the house of representatives by hon.
james a. tawney. new york state was especially honored in the selection
of the president of her commission to speak in behalf of the domestic
exhibitors. hon. edward h. harriman was then introduced by president
francis.


address of president harriman

after briefly complimenting the president and directors of the
exposition, mr. harriman said:

"our 'domestic exhibitors' could have no higher testimonial than that
furnished by the magnificent buildings and grounds of this exposition.
we have here combined in brilliant variety the charms and beauties of
garden, forest, lake and stream, embellished by these splendid
structures, forming an harmonious whole certainly not equaled by any
former exposition. all credit is due the president and directors, whose
intelligence and untiring labors have conquered all obstacles and
brought this world's fair to a most auspicious and successful opening.
one cannot view the result of their labors without being deeply
impressed with the magnitude of their undertaking, and when we consider
the exhibits which have been assembled within these grounds, we are led
irresistibly to an appreciation of the multitude of forces which
contributed to this great work, and particularly to the co-operation
which must have existed to produce the result before us.

"i have the honor on this occasion to speak for our 'domestic
exhibitors.' they are well represented by their works before you, and by
these works you can know them.

"these exhibits represent in concrete form the artistic and industrial
development of this country, and in viewing them one cannot but be
impressed with the great improvement in the conditions affecting our
material and physical welfare and with the corresponding advancement in
our intellectual and esthetic life.

"let us consider for a moment the processes by which this result has
been reached. we have here collected the products of our artistic,
scientific and industrial life. the raw materials of the farm, the
vineyard, the mine and the forest have been transformed by the skilled
artisan, the artist and the architect into the finished products before
you. by the co-operation of all these resources, of all these
activities, of all these workers, this result has been accomplished.
from the felling of the trees in the forest, the tilling of the soil and
the mining of the ore, through all the steps and processes required to
produce from the raw material the complicated machine or the costly
fabric, there must have been co-operation, and all incongruous elements
and resistant forces must have been eliminated or overcome.

"the chief factor, therefore, which has contributed to these results is
the co-operation of all our people. the first law of our civilization is
the co-operation of all individuals to improve the conditions of life.
by division of labor each individual is assigned to or takes his special
part in our social organization. this specialization of labor has become
most minute. not only is this true in scientific and philosophic
research, in professional and business life, but in the simplest and
earliest occupations of men, such as the tilling of the soil, the
specialist is found bringing to the aid of his industry expert and
scientific knowledge.

"... in the division of labor and the resultant specialization of human
activity we have necessarily different classes of workers, some of whom
have adopted the co-operative idea by forming organizations by which
they seek to better their conditions. no doubt each class of workers has
its particular interests which may be legitimately improved by
co-operation among its members, and thus far the labor organization has
a lawful purpose, but while standing for its rights it cannot
legitimately deny to any other class its rights, nor should it go to the
extent of infringing the personal and inalienable rights of its members
as individuals. on the contrary, it must accord to its own members and
to others the same measure of justice that it demands for itself as an
organization.

"in working out this problem there has been much conflict. indeed,
according to human experience, such conflict could not entirely be
avoided, but in the end each class must recognize that it cannot exist
independently of others; it cannot strike down or defeat the rights or
interests of others without injuring itself. should capital demand more
than its due, by that demand it limits its opportunities, and,
correspondingly, the laborer who demands more than his due thereby takes
away from himself the opportunity to labor. no one can escape this law
of co-operation. self-interest demands that we must observe its just
limitations. we must be ready to do our part and accord to all others
the fair opportunity of doing their part. we must co-operate with and
help our colaborer. we should approach the solution of each question
which may arise with a reasonable and, better still, a friendly spirit.
he who obstructs the reasonable adjustment of these questions, who
fosters strife by appealing to class prejudice, may justly be regarded
by all as an enemy to the best public interests....

"in conclusion, permit me to advert to the louisiana purchase, which we
are now celebrating, and call attention to the importance of that event
in securing to our people the fullest benefit of the co-operative idea.
manifestly, if our government were restricted to the original territory
of the united states, as defined by the treaty of 1783, we must have
encountered in many ways the opposition of governments, some of them
european, which would have occupied the territory beyond our original
south and west boundaries. our trade and commerce moving from or to our
original territory would, necessarily, have been largely restricted by
hostile foreign powers. the louisiana purchase not only more than
doubled our territory by adding a country rich in material resources,
but gave us control of the mississippi river, and made possible the
acquisition of the oregon territory, the mexican cessions and the
annexation of texas. ...

"though much has been done towards the development of this imperial
domain, yet we may truly say that we have only seen the beginning of
that development. the possibilities for the future are boundless. with a
land of unparalleled resources, occupied by a people combining the best
elements of our modern civilization and governed by laws evolved from
the highest and best progress of the human race, no eye can foresee the
goal to which a co-operation of all these forces must lead."

the mexican commissioner, a. r. nuncio, spoke in behalf of the foreign
exhibitors. the concluding address was made by hon. william h. taft,
secretary of war, who attended as the special representative of the
president. at its conclusion the president of the united states, in the
white house at washington, pressed a key that started the machinery,
unfurled the flags, set the cascades in motion, and thus opened the
exposition.


beneficent results

to the question "was the louisiana purchase exposition a success?" the
answer must be an unqualified affirmative. the value of any great
exposition cannot be measured in dollars and cents any more than it can
be measured in pounds and ounces. the great fair at st. louis was not
projected as a money-making undertaking. it was held to commemorate a
great event in american history and was designed to arouse a popular
interest in the story of the acquisition of the louisiana territory and
its glorious results; to more closely knit together the peoples of the
earth in good fellowship and brotherly love; to give to all nations an
opportunity to demonstrate to each other their progress in material
things; to awaken in the american people a sense of civic pride and a
determined resolution to maintain and advance the prestige which they
now enjoy among the nations of the earth. having fulfilled all this, who
shall say that the exposition has been a failure?


fair officials from new york

the state of new york has every reason to be proud of her connection
with the great fair, not only in her official participation, which
through the generous action and hearty support of the executive and the
legislature was on a most liberal and comprehensive scale, but many of
her sons were prominent in its building, in the creation of its artistic
effects, and no less in the administration of its various departments.
at the very inception of the work new york was honored in the
appointment of martin h. glynn, of albany, n. y., as a member of the
national commission. mr. glynn was afterwards elected vice-chairman of
the commission and was one of its most active members. laurence h.
grahame, of new york city, was secretary of the national commission. his
genial personality, his wide acquaintance and his long experience in
newspaper work admirably fitted him for the duties of the position,
which he performed with fidelity. mrs. daniel manning, of albany, was
president of the board of lady managers. the position was one requiring
marked executive ability, dignity and tact. mrs. manning performed the
arduous duties falling to her lot with a grace and cordiality which won
for her the love and esteem of the official delegates to the exposition
from throughout the world. she was signally honored on many occasions
and is one of new york's most distinguished daughters. judge franklin
ferriss, the general counsel for the exposition company, and one of st.
louis' most eminent lawyers, went forth from our state many years ago to
seek and find his fortune in the west.


chiefs of exhibit departments

of the thirteen chiefs of departments in the division of exhibits new
york lays claim to six. the department of education and social economy,
as well as the department of congresses, was under the direction of dr.
howard j. rogers, now assistant commissioner of education of the state
of new york, and formerly deputy superintendent of public instruction;
also united states director of education and social economy at the paris
exposition in 1900.

milan h. hulbert had charge of the great department of manufactures and
varied industries. mr. hulbert is a native of brooklyn and a graduate of
the brooklyn polytechnic institute. he was in charge of the department
of varied industries for the united states commission to paris in 1900.
the art department was presided over by professor halsey c. ives, now of
st. louis, but formerly of new york state. the old school house in which
he received the ground work of his education still stands at montour
falls, schuyler county. professor ives was also chief of arts at the
columbian exposition in 1893. the chief of the department of machinery,
thomas m. moore, is a native, and has always been a resident, of new
york city. he was in charge of the departments of machinery,
transportation, agricultural implements, graphic arts and ordnance at
the pan american exposition in buffalo.

of late years dr. tarleton h. bean, chief of the forest, fish and game
department, has been a resident of new york state. in 1895 he became the
director of the aquarium in new york city and rebuilt that
establishment. he was chief of the department of forestry and fisheries
for the united states at the paris exposition in 1900.

the chief of the department of physical culture, james e. sullivan, has
always been a new yorker. he is an acknowledged athletic record
authority and editor of the official athletic almanac. he was in charge
of the american contingent that competed in the olympic games at the
paris exposition, and was also director of athletics at the pan american
exposition.


sculptors

the heroic equestrian statue "the apotheosis of st. louis," generally
considered one of the finest works of its kind, which stood at the very
gateway to the fair grounds, symbolizing the cordial welcome extended by
the city to her guests from every part of the world, was the work of
charles h. niehaus, of new york city. the sculpture of the louisiana
purchase monument, the surmounting figure typifying "peace" and the base
decoration of groups representing scenes connected with the purchase,
was by karl bitter, chief of sculpture of the exposition, another new
yorker. just in front of the monument and looking upon the grand basin
were four groups portraying frontier life, entitled "the buffalo dance",
"a step to civilization", "peril of the plains", and "a cowboy at rest",
all being the work of solon borglum, another new yorker. the crowning
artistic and architectural effects of the whole fair were embraced in
festival hall and the cascades. these were the work of two new york men,
cass gilbert and emanuel s. masqueray. mr. gilbert was the architect of
festival hall and mr. masqueray designed the cascades and the colonnade
of states. mr. masqueray had other notable pieces of work in evidence
about the grounds.

the palace of manufactures, standing just to the east of the plaza st.
louis, was the work of messrs. carrere and hastings, also new yorkers.
it was regarded as one of the most successful structures upon the
grounds from an architect's point of view and it was appropriate that to
new york men should have been intrusted the construction of the building
in which exhibits of manufactures were displayed, in view of the
pre-eminence of our state from a manufacturing and commercial
standpoint.

and so throughout all the departments of the great fair and throughout
the season, one constantly encountered those who by some tie were bound
to new york. many of her sons who had gone forth in their youth came
back and called at the new york state building and recalled some
pleasant incident of the old days or made grateful acknowledgment of
some benefit which had come to them from their native state. one of the
most delightful features of all the experiences of those who had the
honor officially to represent the empire state at st. louis was the
meeting of the sons and daughters who had long since left home.


conclusion

the gates had scarcely closed for the last time when the work of
destruction and demolition began. all of the beauties of the dream city
which for seven months had been the admiration of thousands and an
inspiration to all to do higher and better things, were swept away
almost in a night and soon the whole scene will be restored to a park.
to those who had come to love its majestic structures, its placid
waterways, its attractive vistas and its fairy like illumination, comes
a pang of regret tempered with the feeling of gratefulness that it ever
existed and that it was their privilege to witness it secure in the
knowledge that it shall always be theirs to remember and to dream of.
most effectually was the whole story told in an address on chicago day,
by ernest mcgaphey, a poet from that city.

"in its truest sense this exposition is epic and dramatic. the mere
prose of it will come to lie neglected on the dusty shelves of
statisticians, but its poetry will be a priceless legacy to generations
that will follow. and thus there is one light only which may not fade
from the windows of time--one glint to illuminate the flight of the
dying years--that gleam which lives in fancy and in memory.

"and when this vision of magic departs; when the ivory towers have
vanished, and the sound of flowing waters has been stilled, there will
exist with us yet the recollection of it all. and so at the end the most
enduring fabric known to man is woven of the warp and woof of dreams.
the canvas of the great painters will crumble, the curves of noble
statuary be ground into dust by time, and all this pageantry of art and
commerce disappear. but memory will keep a record of these days as a
woman will treasure old love letters, and in the last analysis the
height and breadth, the depth and scope of this splendid achievement
shall be measured by a dream."



chapter ii

the louisiana purchase exposition commission, state of new york

[illustration]


the first steps looking toward the official participation of the state
of new york in the louisiana purchase exposition were taken by the
legislature of 1902, which passed the following act, receiving executive
approval on april 7, 1902:

chapter 421, laws of 1902

an act to provide for the representation of the state of new york at the
louisiana purchase exposition at saint louis, missouri, and making an
appropriation therefor.

became a law, april 7, 1902, with the approval of the governor. passed,
three-fifths being present.

_the people of the state of new york, represented in senate and
assembly, do enact as follows:_

section 1. the governor is hereby authorized to appoint twelve
commissioners to represent the state of new york at the louisiana
purchase exposition to be held at saint louis, missouri, beginning on
the first day of may, nineteen hundred and three, and ending on the
thirtieth day of november, nineteen hundred and three, and for the
purposes of this act such commissioners shall be known as the "louisiana
purchase exposition commission." such commission shall encourage and
promote a full and complete exhibit of the commercial, educational,
industrial, artistic and other interests of the state and its citizens
at such exposition, and shall provide, furnish and maintain, during the
exposition, a building or room for a state exhibit and for the official
headquarters of the state, and for the comfort and convenience of its
citizens and its exhibitors.

2. the members of the commission shall receive no compensation for their
services, but shall be entitled to the actual necessary expenses
incurred while in discharge of duties imposed upon them by the
commission. such commission may provide a secretary whose compensation,
to be fixed by it, shall be at the rate of not to exceed twenty-five
hundred dollars a year for all services to be performed in carrying out
the provisions of this act, and may also provide such other clerical
assistance and office facilities as it deems necessary, but no salaries
or expenses shall be incurred for a longer period than ninety days after
the close of the exposition.

3. the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be
necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the treasury not
otherwise appropriated for the purposes of this act. such money shall be
paid by the treasurer on the warrant of the comptroller issued upon a
requisition signed by the president and secretary of the commission,
accompanied by an estimate of the expenses for the payment of which the
money so drawn is to be applied. within ninety days after the close of
the exposition, such commission shall make a verified report to the
comptroller of the disbursements made by it, and shall return to the
state treasury the unexpended balance of money drawn in pursuance of
this act. no indebtedness nor obligation shall be incurred under this
act in excess of the appropriation herein made.

4. the commission shall, as requested by the governor, from time to
time, render to him reports of its proceedings.

5. this act shall take effect immediately.


the commission

pursuant to the provisions of this act, governor odell named as the
twelve members of the commission: edward h. harriman, of new york city;
louis stern, of new york city; edward lyman bill, of new york city;
william berri, of brooklyn; cyrus e. jones, of jamestown; lewis nixon,
of new york city; john c. woodbury, of rochester; frank s. mcgraw, of
buffalo; john k. stewart, of amsterdam; james h. callanan, of
schenectady; john young, of geneseo; and mrs. norman e mack, of buffalo.

a few months after the appointment of the commission, cyrus e. jones, of
jamestown, resigned, and the governor named frederick r. green, of
fredonia, in his place.

the results accomplished by the commission as attested by the number of
awards received in all of the exhibit departments; in the beauty and
utility of the state building; in the careful procedure as to the
expenditure of state funds, all bear testimony to the wisdom of the
chief executive in the appointment of a commission, all of the members
of which were of acknowledged prominence either in professional,
business or social life.

throughout its entire existence the commission worked with a singular
unanimity and with a hearty interest but seldom found in commissions of
this character. it held twenty-five regular meetings and two special
meetings, the aggregate of attendance at all meetings being two hundred
thirty-one, making an average attendance of eight and fifty-nine
hundredths at each meeting. when it is considered that each member had
large personal interests, and that he served the state absolutely
without compensation, only necessary expenses being allowed by statute,
and that a majority of the members of the commission were obliged to
travel from 160 to 450 miles to attend the meetings, its record for
faithfulness to duty as shown by the above figures is one in which it
may take a pardonable pride.


the organization of the commission

by virtue of being first named by the governor, edward h. harriman, of
new york city, became president of the commission, which completed its
organization as follows: vice-president, william berri; treasurer,
edward lyman bill. executive committee: louis stern, chairman; william
berri, lewis nixon, john k. stewart and james h. callanan. auditing
committee: james h. callanan and john k. stewart.

there was but one name presented for secretary of the commission, that
of mr. charles a. ball, of wellsville. he was unanimously elected, with
compensation of $2,500 per annum, the appointment taking effect december
8, 1902. in its choice of this officer the commission was most
fortunate. efficient, faithful and courteous and with a wide circle of
acquaintances, particularly among the prominent men of the empire state,
mr. ball was peculiarly qualified for the duties of the position. he was
popular with his superiors and his subordinates, and so directed the
work of the several departments within the commission's jurisdiction as
to procure the very best results.

anthony pfau was later appointed bookkeeper and assistant to the
secretary, and in the handling of a vast amount of detail work displayed
commendable skill and patience. seward h. french, stenographer to the
secretary, was always at his post of duty and cheerfully and faithfully
served the commission at all times. herman kandt, assistant bookkeeper,
completed the office force.

an informal meeting was held in september, 1902, shortly after the names
of the commission were announced by the governor. at this meeting an
invitation was extended on behalf of the louisiana purchase exposition
company to attend the ceremonies in connection with the allotment of
sites for the various state buildings. the president appointed
commissioners stewart, woodbury and callanan a committee to represent
the commission on that occasion, and on behalf of the state of new york,
to accept the site for its building. the ceremonies in connection with
this occasion are described elsewhere. the first formal meeting of the
commission was called on december 3, 1902, at 120 broadway, new york
city.

at this meeting the commission determined to maintain offices at 120
broadway, new york city, until such time as the new york state building
was opened at st. louis, and for the expedition of business the
following by-laws were provided:


by-laws

_first_. the officers of the louisiana purchase exposition
commission of the state of new york shall consist of a president,
vice-president, treasurer and secretary.

_second_. regular meetings of the commission shall be held in the

_third_. three members of the commission shall constitute a quorum
at all regular meetings.

_fourth_. an executive committee of five members, appointed by the

  5. unfinished business
  6. communications
  7. new business


a state building

these preliminary formalities over, the commission began in earnest the
work of preparation for the state's participation at st. louis.
believing that the most conspicuous feature of the state's participation
in the exposition, especially so far as the impression which would be
made upon visitors was concerned, would be her state building, the
commission gave its first attention to this feature. having been
assigned such a commanding site, the commission kept in mind that it was
incumbent upon them to erect upon it a building of appropriate dignity
and dimensions. it soon became evident that, with the appropriation
already made, it would be impossible to erect a suitable building,
maintain it and make suitable exhibits in the great departments of the
fair in which the state of new york stands pre-eminent. steps were,
therefore, taken to procure an additional appropriation from the
legislature of 1903, the matter being placed in the hands of the
executive committee.


the architect

at the april meeting mr. clarence luce, of new york city, was appointed
the commission's architect, and the plans for a state building presented
by him were accepted. on june thirtieth a special meeting was called for
the purpose of considering bids for the erection of the building and
hearing the report of a special committee, consisting of messrs. luce
and van brunt, who had visited st. louis to further the interests of the
commission in this matter.


the contractors

bids were received from several firms of contractors, ranging from
$80,000 down to the contract price of the building, viz., $56,518, at
which figure messrs. caldwell & drake, of columbus, ind., contracted to
complete the building in accordance with plans and specifications of the
architect. the construction work was immediately inaugurated and was
pushed forward so rapidly that the december meeting of the commission,
which was held on the eighteenth of that month, took place in the new
york state building on the world's fair grounds. after inspecting the
building and carefully noting the progress which was being made, the
commission adjourned to meet at the planters hotel at seven o'clock in
the evening. through the courtesy of honorable george j. kobusch,
president of the st. louis car company, the private car "electra"
conveyed the members of the commission to the grounds and return.


embellishment and furnishing

an offer from the aeolian company, of new york city, to install, at its
own expense, a pipe organ in the building was accepted, and an
appropriation of $3,500 was made for an ornamental case to contain the
organ which would be a distinctive addition to the decoration of the
entrance hallway. in the meantime the matter of furnishing the state
building had been in the hands of a furniture committee, who had made an
exhaustive investigation upon the subject. in march a contract was made
with herter brothers, of new york city, for furnishing the state
building, in accordance with specifications prepared by the commission,
for $18,000.


the completion of the building

by dint of prodigous effort the building was completed, entirely
furnished and ready for the reception of guests on the opening day of
the exposition, at which time the offices of the commission were opened
in the state building, the new york offices remaining open throughout
the summer in charge of harry a. sylvester.

the architect was commended for the prompt completion of his work in the
following resolutions:

"*whereas*, in originality of design, perfection in detail and
attractiveness in equipment, the new york state building at the
louisiana purchase exposition is thoroughly representative of the
dignity and position of the empire state,

"_resolved_, therefore, that the thanks of this commission be
tendered to the architect, mr. clarence luce, as a token of our
appreciation of his skill, talent and artistic tastes in creating a
structure which meets with the warmest approval of this commission, and
which is a fitting home for new york at the world's fair of 1904.

"_resolved_, that the secretary be instructed to forward to mr.
luce a copy of these resolutions, suitably engrossed."

throughout the entire exposition period there were but very few days
that from one to three commissioners were not present at the state
building.

by resolution the commission determined that the lady commissioner and
the wives of commissioners, assisted by the official hostess, should be
hostesses of the state building during the period of the exposition, and
in the absence of those, that the official hostess should act in that
capacity, and it was further determined that any commissioner or a
majority of the commissioners present at the new york state building at
any time should constitute a house committee, and have full charge of
the state building.


plans for participation

during the earlier meetings of the commission they were waited upon by
representatives of the exposition company, and by committees or
representatives of organizations within the state either offering to
co-operate with the commission in the preparation of exhibit material or
requesting appropriations from the commission's funds to enable them to
prepare exhibits.

in february, 1903, honorable george l. parker, a representative of
president francis, addressed the commission, urging them to see that new
york state was properly represented. he, stated that the people of the
west expected great things of new york state; that the city of st. louis
and the territory the acquisition of which was commemorated by the fair,
spent large sums of money in the city of new york alone, and for that
reason it was hoped and expected that new york should lead the other
states of the union.

later in the year, dr. j. a. holmes, chief of the department of mines
and metallurgy, appeared before the commission by invitation and made
some interesting remarks concerning the scientific exhibit, which he
felt it incumbent upon the state to make. he stated that there was no
geological survey, either national or state, as valuable as that of the
state of new york, and strongly advocated that a model oil well derrick
be erected.

the legislature of 1903 passed two acts which affected either directly
or indirectly the work of the commission. the first act provided $50,000
for participation in the dedication ceremonies of the exposition and is
as follows:


chapter 189, laws of 1903

an act making an appropriation for the due and appropriate participation
by the state in the ceremonies attending the dedication of buildings of
the louisiana purchase exposition.

became a law, april 22, 1903, with the approval of the governor. passed,
three-fifths being present.

_the people of the state of new york, represented in senate and
assembly, do enact as follows:_

section 1. the sum of fifty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may
be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any money in the treasury,
not otherwise appropriated, payable to the order of the governor, as he
may require the same, to be expended by him in such manner as he may
deem proper, for the due and appropriate participation by the state in
the ceremonies attending the dedication of buildings of the louisiana
purchase exposition, to be held on april thirtieth, and may first and
second, nineteen hundred and three, in the city of saint louis; and for
the transportation, subsistence and other necessary expenses of the
commander-in-chief and his staff, and of such portion of the national
guard or naval militia of this state as may be directed to attend, and
for the replacement by purchase of such military property of the state,
as may be rendered unserviceable by this duty; provided that officers
and men performing this duty shall serve without pay.

sec. 2. this act shall take effect immediately.

the second act amended the original act providing for state
representation, and increased the commission's appropriation by
$200,000, making $300,000 in all.

the act follows:

chapter 546, laws of 1903

an act to amend chapter four hundred and twenty-one of the laws of
nineteen hundred and two, entitled "an act to provide for the
representation of the state of new york at the louisiana purchase

chief executive officer

the title of the secretary was thereupon changed to that of secretary
and chief executive officer, and he was clothed with all the authority
and duties pertaining to the latter position, his salary being increased
to $4,000 per annum. later his duties were further prescribed by the
following resolution:

"_resolved_, that the chief executive officer shall exercise such
direction and management of the office as shall make effective the
various agencies employed. he shall nominate to the commission all
clerks and employees in all the departments. he shall fix and establish
all salaries of officers, clerks and employees, subject to the approval

economy, and he was placed in charge of the exhibits in the latter
department in addition to those of the department of education.


appropriations for exhibits

the following appropriations were made for exhibits:

horticulture and floriculture                         $20,000
agriculture, including live stock and dairy products   25,000
education                                              20,000

fine arts                                              10,000
                                                      -------
  total                                              $108,000

in the departments of agriculture, horticulture, and education and
social economy the work was placed in charge of the chiefs above named.
the scientific exhibit was placed in charge of the director of the state
museum. all of the above exhibits were subject to the supervisory
control of the chief executive officer. the forest, fish and game
exhibit was placed under direct control of the chief executive officer,
valuable assistance being rendered, however, by the forest, fish and
game commission.

the fine arts exhibit was provided for in the following resolution:

"_resolved_, that mr. w. h. low, of the society of american
artists; mr. h. w. watrous, of the national academy of design; mr. j.
carroll beckwith, a member of the art commission of the city of new
york; mr. louis loeb, of the society of illustrators; mr. frank c.
jones, delegate to the fine arts federation from the national academy of
design; mr. grosvenor atterbury, of the architectural league of new
york, and mr. herbert adams, of the national sculpture society, be named
as an executive committee on art for the state of new york, whose duty
it shall be to aid the chief executive officer of this commission to
develop the new york state art exhibit at the louisiana purchase
exposition, said executive committee to serve without expense to this
commission."

by means of the various agencies provided for the preparation of
exhibits, the work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, the
commission keeping in touch with its progress through monthly reports
filed with the chief executive officer by the heads of various
departments.


assistance by exposition officers

by the time the commission held its meeting in st. louis in december
space had been assigned for most all of the state exhibits. there was an
evident disposition on the part of the exposition company to do all in
their power to assist the state of new york in making its participation
an unqualified success. in appreciation of this attitude the following
resolution was passed at the meeting held in the city of st. louis in
december:

"_resolved_, that the members of the new york commission desire to
express to the president of the louisiana purchase exposition company
and the heads of the various departments with whom they have been
brought in personal contact, their appreciation of the delightful
courtesy extended them. it is obvious that there is a desire on the part
of the exposition authorities to facilitate the departmental work of new
york in connection with the exposition. we cannot fail to express our
admiration of the gigantic task which the officers of this great
international fair have carried to such a successful culmination. in the
entire history of expositions, there has been evidenced no greater
progress, and such work could not have been accomplished save through
the most prodigious efforts on the part of the projectors of this vast
enterprise. when st. louis opens her exposition gates next year, it will
be to invite the world to witness the greatest exposition in all
history. and be it further

"_resolved_, that the secretary be instructed to forward a copy of
this resolution to president francis and the heads of the various
departments of the exposition."


new york day

the commission took considerable care in the choosing of a day to be
known as "new york day." it was considered important that a date should
be named upon which it would be possible for the governor to be present.
moreover it seemed essential that no date during the heat of the summer
should be designated, as but few new yorkers would be apt to be present
at st. louis at that time, and, therefore, after mature consideration,
october fourth was designated as new york state day.

the legislature of 1904 passed an additional appropriation of $40,000,
by chapter 640, which is given below:

chapter 640, laws of 1904

an act, to make an additional appropriation to provide for the
representation of the state of new york at the louisiana purchase
exposition at saint louis, missouri.

[became a law may 9, 1904, with the approval of the governor.

passed, three-fifths being present.]

_the people of the state of new york, represented in senate and
assembly, do enact as follows_:

section 1. the sum of forty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may
be necessary, in addition to the money heretofore appropriated, is
hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the treasury, not otherwise
appropriated, for the purpose of providing for the representation of the
state of new york at the louisiana purchase exposition at saint louis,
missouri. the money hereby appropriated shall be applicable to the
purposes specified in chapter four hundred and twenty-one of the laws of
nineteen hundred and two, as amended by chapter five hundred and
forty-six of the laws of nineteen hundred and three, and shall be paid
out in accordance with the provisions of such act, by the treasurer on
the warrant of the comptroller issued upon a requisition signed by the
president and secretary of the commission, accompanied by an estimate of
the expenses for the payment of which the money so drawn is to be
applied.

*sec.*2. this act shall take effect immediately.

this made possible the elaboration of some of the plans which the
commission had in mind.


history of the exposition period

the history of the exposition period will be found in other chapters of
this report. a description of the state building, detailed accounts of
the dedicatory exercises and the exercises upon state day, as well as
other important functions, are given. the exhibits in the various
departments are fully described, and the results of the inspection by
the juries are given.

throughout the entire life of the commission death did not enter its
ranks, nor the ranks of its attaches, nor did any untoward incident
arise, although early in the morning of november twenty-first a
catastrophe was narrowly averted. in the middle of the night a fire was
found smouldering in the basement of the building, which, through the
prompt action of the watchman on duty, was extinguished without doing
extensive damage. many were asleep in the building at the time, and but
for the presence of mind and courage of those on duty the consequences
might have been too fearful to contemplate.


disposition of exhibits

at a meeting of the commission, held just before the close of the
exposition, the following resolution was passed:

"_resolved_, that the louisiana purchase exposition commission of
the state of new york hereby authorizes the secretary and chief
executive officer, charles a. ball, to turn over to the lewis and clark
exposition commission of the state of new york any of the exhibits, or
such part thereof as the latter may desire in the various exhibit
departments working under the auspices of the louisiana purchase
exposition commission of the state of new york for the use of said lewis
and clark exposition commission, state of new york, with the proviso
that in the case of individual exhibits forming a part of said exhibits
the lewis and clark exposition commission, state of new york, must get
the consent of the owners of said exhibits and relieve the commission of
all responsibility relating thereto and return said individual exhibits
to their owners at the close of the lewis and clark exposition, it being
understood, however, that said lewis and clark exposition commission
must take possession of these exhibits not later than december 15,
1904."

upon requisition from the latter commission the secretary and chief
executive officer turned over to the lewis and clark exposition
commission the following material: the complete exhibit of the state in
the departments of education and social economy; the complete exhibit in
the department of forestry, fish and game, with the exception of the
log-cabin and the forest nursery and a portion of the state exhibits in
the departments of mines and metallurgy and agriculture.


acknowledgment to president francis and others

president francis and the exposition officials generally throughout the
entire exposition period extended to the commission every courtesy and
evinced a hearty interest in the work of new york, endeavoring to
further the interests of the commission in every possible direction.
desiring to express in suitable terms its appreciation of these
courtesies the commission also passed the following resolutions at its
meeting held at the close of the exposition:


"whereas, the empire state is about to close its official connection
with this, the greatest of world's fairs; and,

"whereas, the members of the louisiana purchase exposition commission of
the state of new york, appointed by the governor, desire to express to
the officials of the fair their sincere appreciation of the hearty
co-operation which they have rendered the members of this commission, in
every way facilitating the work of new york in each department of state
representation; and,

"whereas, in all of the commission's relations with the officers of the
exposition, not only has every courtesy been shown the commission, but
there has been a friendly desire to promote their interests; therefore,
be it

"_resolved_, that the cordial thanks of this commission be extended
to the president of the louisiana purchase exposition commission,
honorable david r. francis; to the secretary, honorable walter b.
stevens; to the director of exhibits, honorable frederick j.v. skiff; to
the director of works, honorable isaac s. taylor, and to the chiefs of
each exhibit department of the exposition, with whom the commission or
its representatives have been brought in contact; be it further

"_resolved_, that these resolutions be spread upon the permanent
records of the commission and a copy of the same forwarded to each of
the above named exposition officials."


commendation for staff

with the exception of closing up its affairs, this marked the end of the
commission's work and before adjournment the following resolutions
commending the efficiency and faithfulness of its employees were spread
upon the minutes, and a copy was sent to each attache:

"whereas, this commission is about to close its work, and for this
reason must necessarily very soon dispense with the services of the
appointees who have served under it since its organization and during
the life of the louisiana purchase exposition, it is eminently fitting
that we make record of the faithfulness and loyalty with which said
appointees of every character whatsoever have discharged their
respective duties; therefore, be it

"_resolved_, that we take pleasure in certifying to the efficient
manner in which our secretary and chief executive officer, mr. charles
a. ball, has discharged the important duties attached to his position.
from the very inception of the work upon which this commission entered,
mr. ball has proven to be most loyal and faithful, and has ever been
ready and willing to carry out the instructions of this commission. his
wide acquaintance with the people of new york state, and especially with
her official representatives, has been of inestimable service to this
commission, not only while the various exhibits were being developed,
but also during the exposition period itself. that mr. ball has
popularized the commission's work at st. louis is attested by the
universal commendation which he has received from new york people who
have come in contact with him during their visits to the exposition and
to the new york state building. mr. ball has shown himself to be most
capable in directing the various appointees at the state building and in
the several exhibit departments in the discharge of their various
duties, and has not only carried an this work to the best interests of
the state, but in such a manner as to greatly endear himself to this
commission and to all of its employees as well. his foresight in
providing for the necessary vigilance during the hours of the night in
the protection of the lives of those in the state building, once
seriously jeopardized by fire, as well as the property of the state from
loss by fire, is especially entitled to the sincere thanks and gratitude
of this commission;

"_resolved_, that in chief clerk anthony pfau, stenographer seward
h. french, clerks herman w. kandt and harry a. sylvester, the experience
of this commission has demonstrated that it made most worthy selections.
they have been faithful assistants to mr. ball in the discharge of his
duties and this commission gladly records its commendation of the
ability with which they have discharged their duties;

"_resolved_, that we extend to the honorable frank j. le fevre, the
superintendent, and mr. george b. cowper, the assistant superintendent,
our sincere appreciation for the most praiseworthy manner in which they
have discharged the difficult duties falling to them, and our very
pleasant relations with them shall be ever held in grateful remembrance;

"_resolved_, that we have been especially gratified with the highly
satisfactory manner in which mrs. dore lyon, the hostess, mrs. f. b.
applebee, the assistant hostess, and miss laura c. macmartin, the matron
at the state building, have acquitted themselves of the duties assigned
to them. we especially accord them our highest appreciation;

"_resolved_, that this commission especially commends the faithful
and efficient services rendered by mr. delancey m. ellis, mr. j. h.
durkee, mr. charles h. vick, mr. a. b. strough, mr. h. h. hindshaw, mr.
harry watrous and mr. charles m. kurtz, and all their assistants in the
various exhibit departments, in which our state has signalized her
pre-eminence as shown by the large number of awards received. these
gentlemen have always proven loyal to the interests of the state and to
this commission and they are entitled to the highest regard by this
commission;

"_resolved_, that for all the subordinate employees of this
commission throughout the state building and all the departments working
under this commission, this commission desires at this time to make
complete record of their efficient loyalty and faithfulness in the
discharge of the various duties assigned to them, and we especially
attest our full appreciation for their efforts at all times to make the
work of this commission in enhancing the interests of the state a
complete success;

"_resolved_, that we cannot forget the efficiency of mr. hugh j.
baldwin, who, we believe, by his watchfulness at the time of the fire in
the state building, saved the lives of many of the occupants of the
building as well as the property of the state; for mr. hugh w. bingham,
also on duty during that night, who so efficiently aided mr. baldwin in
protecting life and property, we here record our sincerest gratitude;
and be it further

"_resolved_, that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of
the proceedings of this commission and the secretary is hereby
authorized to transmit a copy of these resolutions to each of the
employees of this commission."

chapter iii

new york state building


the new york state building was admirably located upon one of the most
attractive sites within the gift of the exposition company, to whom the
commission, in behalf of the state of new york, desire to make grateful
acknowledgment.


the site

the building stood on the brow of a hill, the land sloping off gently to
the north, and faced upon a broad plaza, through which ran one of the
most frequented highways within the grounds, known as commonwealth
avenue. for its neighbors were the buildings of kansas, iowa,
massachusetts, ohio, wisconsin and oklahoma, while westward, at the foot
of the hill, was located the great cage erected by the united states
government, which held the exhibit of live birds from the smithsonian
institute.

to no state, with the possible exception of missouri, the home state,
was so large a site assigned as to new york. its extent, the undulating
character of the grounds, and the presence of many beautiful, stately
trees, afforded countless opportunities for landscape effects. from the
opening day the grounds presented a charming appearance, the well-kept
lawns giving place here and there to large beds of nasturtiums, poppies,
cannae, and rhododendrons, while at the lowest point on the grounds,
near the northeast corner, was located a lily pond. it was filled with
the choicest aquatic plants of every variety, which were furnished
through the courtesy of shaw's gardens and the missouri botanical
society. during the season many beautiful bouquets of varicolored
blossoms were gathered and its surface was almost entirely covered by
odd shaped leaves from which peeped here and there the buds of pond
lilies.


transfer of site to the state

the site was formally turned over to the commission on october 1, 1902,
and was received by a committee appointed by the president, consisting,
of commissioners john k. stewart, john c. woodbury and james h.
callanan. the ceremony took place in the presence of honorable david r.
francis, president of the exposition company, the director of works, and
other exposition officials, the committee of the new york state
commission and invited guests.

the exercises were brief but impressive. president francis spoke as
follows:


remarks of president francis

"a universal exposition, either in the united states or elsewhere, would
be incomplete if the empire state of the american union were not
represented. this site has been selected for the great state of new
york, and upon this location we trust there will be erected a structure
which will be in keeping with the glorious record new york and her sons
have made from the beginning of this country. new york needs no encomium
from me, none in fact from her sons. she speaks for herself. the
director of works will present to the chairman of the new york
commission the site for the building of the state of new york."

honorable isaac s. taylor, director of works, then formally presented
the site to the commission, handing to commissioner john k. stewart a
handsome banner of purple silk, upon which was painted the coat of arms
of the state of new york. driving the staff in the ground, thus marking
the site, commissioner stewart said:


remarks of commissioner stewart

"mr. president and gentlemen of the commission: in behalf of new york
state i receive this emblem. we shall erect here a building suitable for
the great empire state of new york. i wish to introduce to you honorable
james h. callanan, of schenectady, who will respond in behalf of the
commission."

commissioner james h. callanan then made the following address:


address of commissioner callanan

"in behalf of the commission representing the commonwealth of new york,
i take pleasure in accepting the site allotted for the empire state's
building at the louisiana purchase exposition. with this acceptance i
beg you to receive the assurance from our commission that new york will
do her share to make the exposition an unquestioned success. upon this
site we expect to erect a handsome and commodious structure where new
yorkers may meet one another during the exposition, and where they may
welcome their fellow citizens from every section of our common country.
new york is also desirous of having exhibited here upon these spacious
grounds the evidences of her prestige in the domain of manufacture, of
commerce, of agriculture, of science and of art.

"the american people are progressive. the indomitable courage and
ambition of the american knows no cessation of effort, no lagging
behind. the expositions held in our country have celebrated great epochs
of our advancement, and they will be pointed out to future generations
as evidences of the onward march of a people unparalleled in the history
of the human race.

"to these great achievements of a mighty people it is impossible to
estimate the share contributed by the sturdy pioneers and their
descendants of this vast tract of country, the cession of which more
than doubled the area of our country a century ago. what great states
have been carved out of this territory! what wonderful wealth of
resources have been brought forth here! what a splendid citizenship has
been established in this vast region! new york rejoices with you in the
giant strides made by this newer section of our country.

"it certainly is most appropriate at this time when the republic is
reaching out as a world power that we should celebrate the anniversary
of the first great chapter in the history of our national expansion.
time has proven that jefferson and his compeers built greater than they
knew, for by that acquisition of territory there was developed a spirit
of national progress that did not cease even when we first learned to
know no superior among the nations of the earth.

"representatives of half a dozen different nations met in the smoking
room of an ocean liner sometime ago. it was suggested that each nation
be toasted. an englishman paid a glowing tribute to his country. a
frenchman lauded his nation and a russian eulogized the land of the
czar. then an american arose and said: 'here is to the united states,
bounded on the north by the north pole, on the east by the rising sun,
on the south by the south pole, and on the west by the setting sun.' as
he finished another american present requested that he be permitted to
attempt an improvement on the toast given by his countryman, which
request was granted. he then toasted the united states in this fashion:
'here's to the united states, bounded on the north by the aurora
borealis, on the east by infinite chaos, on the south by the procession
of the equinoxes, and on the west by the day of judgment.' this indeed
is extravagant language, but that fellow possessed the american spirit
which recognizes no limit to the possibilities of our future.

"i recognize that this is no occasion for state boasting. each state,
territory and american possession is unselfishly interested in the
success of this exposition. however, in connection with what new york is
expected to do for this grand enterprise, you will pardon, i know, this
very brief reference i make to new york's supremacy in population, in
wealth, in manufactures and in commerce. i think it less than twenty
years ago that new york was ahead in agricultural productions, too.
agricultural supremacy has been tending westward for nearly a half
century, however, and we cheerfully surrender to your broad prairies.
iowa, ohio and illinois now outrank us in farm industry, the first once
a part of the louisiana tract and the other two cut from the northwest
territory.

"an eastern farmer on his first visit to the west asked his western
brother how it was that 'he could plow such straight furrows over such
enormous fields.' 'that's easy,' said the native, 'we follow the
parallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude.' that reply was
significant. it demonstrates quite fully where agriculture is king in
the united states.

"the end of the great strides that you are making here in the west is
not in sight. some day your population will be as dense as ours. slowly,
but steadily, the center of population is creeping westward and by
another decade or so it will most likely cross the great father of
waters and move across the land which jefferson's genius gave to the
republic. new york will be more powerful by reason of your greatness.
your increasing productions will contribute to our commercial prestige
more and more as the years roll on to make our metropolis continue to be
the greatest seaport on this continent for all time.

"we share your glory in more ways than this, too. many of the sturdy men
and women who have settled within the confines of this great region were
native new yorkers. our blood has been mingled with yours and our
children are first cousins of yours. new york gave to you because she
could spare and you accepted of us because you wanted the best you could
find.

"new york then bids the people of this section all hail! we are with you
heart and soul to make the exposition a magnificent success. new york
has never failed when a patriotic effort was demanded and as ever before
she will now respond with enthusiasm and will do everything possible
here to sustain her imperial position.

"let us hope that the exposition will accomplish all that is intended.
let our prayer be that all americans who pass within the gates when all
shall be made ready for the opening of this exposition in 1904, will
cherish a higher ambition and a greater love of country and be impelled
to declare with the poet, that

"'there is a land of every land the pride,
beloved of heaven, o'er all the world beside,
where brighter suns dispense serener light,
and milder moons imparadise the night.
oh, thou shalt find howe'er thy footsteps roam,
that land thy country and that spot thy home.'"

at the conclusion of commissioner callanan's remarks the assemblage
dispersed.


dedication of the site

the site was formally dedicated at the time of the formal dedication
ceremonies of the exposition, the special ceremonies being held directly
after the general exercises held in observance of state day, on may 2,
1903. there were present governor and mrs. odell, the governor's staff,
a joint committee of the legislature, exposition officials, members of
the state commission and invited guests.

having assembled upon the site, william berri, vice-president of the
commission, addressed governor odell as follows:


address by vice-president berri

"_governor odell_: it gives the new york state commission to the
louisiana purchase exposition very great pleasure to have you present
here to-day to participate in the simple exercises authorized by the
commission connected with the beginning of the work of construction of
the new york state building which is to be erected upon this site. a
more desirable grant of space on the plateau of states could not have
been made for us by the management of this exposition, and we hope to
place here a building that will add dignity to the location and worthily
represent the state of new york in architectural beauty and practical
usefulness. your commission has been fortunate in securing for the
architect mr. clarence luce, and the plans and drawings which we have
decided upon from his hand give promise of a structure that the state we
represent will be proud of, and we shall also endeavor to so furnish it
and utilize its facilities as to make it a serviceable and attractive
addition to the large number of state buildings that are to be erected
in its vicinity.

"everything has to have a beginning, so we are here to-day to begin our
work of actual construction, and it is specially fitting that we should
have present the governor of new york to assist in the ceremonies
attendant therewith, for he has always heartily supported the project of
the st. louis exposition and has furthered its interests on every
occasion. therefore, on behalf of the new york state commission, i ask
you, governor odell, to honor the great world's fair of 1904 by
performing the first actual work upon the structure we propose to erect
by turning the first spadeful of earth for the state of new york and the
new york state building."

the governor responded briefly, commending the commission for its work,
predicting wonderful benefits to accrue from the exposition and
prophesying that new york would be at the forefront in all of its
departments, after which he lifted the first spadeful of earth upon the
site. he then handed the spade to mrs. odell, who lifted another sod;
after which various ladies in the party performed the same act; at the
conclusion of which the assemblage adjourned.


opening of the building

the building of the state of new york was the only building on the
terrace of states entirely ready for the reception of guests on the
opening day of the exposition. it was a structure thoroughly in keeping
with the dignity and prestige of the great empire state. of marked
simplicity in design, there was in its every line and appointment
evidence of the utmost refinement and culture.

the building was planned primarily for the comfort, accommodation and
convenience of visitors from the empire state, for the holding of such
functions as the commission were required to give in the name of the
state, and for the meetings of any associations or delegations from new
york attending the exposition. it contained no exhibits of any kind, all
of the exhibits being placed in the main exhibit palaces under the
proper subdivision of the official classification.


the architecture

the building was pure italian in style, surmounted by a low dome and
surrounded by verandas and terraces. through the main approach one
entered a large hall sixty feet square, running the full height of the
building, arched and domed in the roman manner, with galleries around
the second story. from this hall ascended the grand staircase, both to
the left and to the right.


mural decorations

under the four arches were handsome mural paintings, the work of florian
peixotto, illustrating "de soto discovering the mississippi," "the
french and indian occupation," "new york in 1803," and "new york in
1903." the four pendentives which supported the dome contained
emblematic pictures representing the four states most benefited by the
louisiana purchase, missouri, louisiana, mississippi and alabama. the
lower hall was of the simple doric order, and the staircase was
augmented by two memorial columns surrounded by dancing groups
beautifully modeled, each column surmounted by a light. to the right of
the entrance hall, and separated from it only by huge pillars, was a
large assembly hall fifty by sixty feet, which was used for receptions,
dinners and other state functions given by the commission. this hall was
most richly decorated in old golds, antwerp blues and siennas and, with
its crystal chandeliers and barrel vaulted ceiling running up through
the second story, was one of the most attractive features of the
building. beyond the grand hall were small dining rooms and serving
rooms connected with the culinary department. to the left of the
entrance hall were waiting rooms, writing rooms and retiring rooms for
the accommodation of guests, while at the extreme south end of the
building were two reading rooms, in which were on file the various daily
papers of the state. but seldom were the reading rooms without visitors
eagerly familiarizing themselves with what had happened at home
subsequent to their departure. also, on the first floor were coat rooms,
a bureau of information, postoffice, telegraph and telephone offices.


offices of the commission

the second floor contained the offices of the commission, which were
occupied by the secretary and the clerical force, and also eight suites
of rooms, consisting of parlor, bedroom and bath, for the accommodation
of the members of the commission and their guests. one of these suites,
more handsomely furnished than the others, was called the "governor's
suite," and was reserved for his exclusive use. while not originally
contemplated, the third floor in both the north and south ends of the
building were finished and partitioned into rooms for the use of the
attaches of the commission. this increased the capacity of the building
by eight rooms.


the sculpture

eminent sculptors were employed to prepare the statuary for the building
which was generally conceded to be as fine as any upon the exposition
grounds, being most admirably adapted to the building as to scale. there
were two massive quadrigae flanking the dome typifying the "progress of
art" and the "progress of commerce," which were the work of phillip
martiny, to whom was also intrusted the work of preparing the elaborate
group, crowding the main entrance to festival hall and entitled "apollo
and the muses." about the huge columns flanking the steps which formed
the approach and again about the columns at the foot of the grand
staircase were dancing groups most gracefully modeled by oscar l. lenz.
the same sculptor was also responsible for the figure of "greeting"
which stood in the lower niche at the north end of the building. the
coat of arms of the state which appeared frequently in the scheme of
decoration was by allen g. newman. the work of reproduction in staff of
the models prepared by the artists was performed by messrs. barth &
staak.


the lighting

the lighting of the building throughout was by electricity, and was
particularly effective in the main entrance hallway, in that the lights,
for the most part, were concealed behind cornices giving a very soft
effect, and displaying to the best advantage the mural paintings.
throughout the building electroliers of special design were used. in the
main hallway they took the form of quaint florentine lanterns which were
particularly rich in modeling and were an important factor in the scheme
of decoration.


the furnishings

the furnishings were most appropriate and harmonious throughout, much of
the furniture having been especially built for the place in which it was
to stand. in the main hallway stood massive florentine chairs and
settees, with high backs, upholstered in mottled embossed leather, each
bearing the coat of arms of the state. the waiting and writing rooms
were appointed and finished in the same simple design which prevailed in
the main hallway, light green being the dominating color, the furniture
being of mahogany, upholstered in bedford cord. the effect was most
restful to the tired visitor who entered the rooms upon a warm summer
day, and their popularity was attested by the number of exposition
visitors, both from new york and elsewhere, who sought their quiet and
refreshing atmosphere to recover from the fatigue of exposition sight
seeing.


the architect

the entire work of designing the building, sculpture, decorations and
furniture was intrusted to mr. clarence luce, of 246 fourth avenue, new
york city. thoroughly familiar with the traditions of the great empire
state, mr. luce made the work committed to him a matter of state as well
as professional pride, and the result of his long experience, coupled
with his artistic temperament and sound judgment, was a building to
which each new yorker pointed with the utmost pride and which each
stranger praised unstintingly. the prompt completion of the work so
thoroughly and satisfactorily done was a source of gratification to the
commission, who at the first meeting held in the building passed
commendatory resolutions concerning mr. luce.

there were state buildings which represented an outlay of considerably
more money, but none which typified the commonwealth for which it stood
more thoroughly than did the new york state building.


the restaurant

a pleasant feature was a private restaurant, conducted by messrs. bayno
& pindat, of new york city, the former being the inventor of an electric
range which was used in the preparation of food. the kitchen and
commissary department was in the basement at the north end of the
building. the privileges of the restaurant were by card only, and were
extended to new yorkers, exposition officials and prominent exposition
visitors. the cuisine was most excellent, and throughout the season
appetizing meals were served on the spacious verandas at the north end
of the building, over which canopies had been erected, the illumination
being furnished in the evening by electric lights, contained in japanese
lanterns. no restaurant upon the grounds enjoyed a greater popularity
among those who were privileged to use it than did that of the new york
state building.


the organ

to the aeolian company, of new york city, the commission is indebted for
one of the features of the building. this company placed a magnificent
pipe organ in the east balcony of the rotunda, and in the gallery north
of the grand hall, nearly 100 feet away, was installed an echo organ,
while a set of cathedral chimes sounded softly from still another
distant part of the building. all three instruments were under control
of the organist at the console located upon the main floor of the
entrance hall, and could be played either by hand or by music rolls
manufactured by the aeolian company. the organ was equipped with an
electric keyboard which permitted the playing of all three instruments
or any single one, as the operator desired. the main instrument was
contained in an artistic case, which, with its decorative ornament, was
built by charles and jacob blum, of new york city, and was an important
enrichment of the hall.

mr. s. h. grover, a representative of the company, was in attendance
throughout the summer and gave a recital each day at three o'clock in
the afternoon. these recitals soon came to be a feature of the
exposition, and were largely attended by music lovers.

the program played on new york state day is given below, and is a fair
specimen of the programs rendered throughout the season.

  overture, "oberon"                              von weber
  serenade                                        schubert
  the nightingale                                 delibes
  overture, "stradella"                           flotow
  berceuse, "jocelyn"                             godard
  selections, no. 11, "la boheme"                 puccini
  am meer                                         schubert
  introduction, act iii, "lohengrin"              wagner


the piano

the commission also acknowledges the courtesy of steinway & co. in
placing in the state building one of the finest instruments ever turned
out by this famous firm of piano builders. its purity of tone and
singing qualities were remarkable, and during the season several
recitals were given upon it by eminent musicians. the piano was
appropriately named "the wave," illustrating as it did the wonderful
waterways of the empire state. the case was made of white hard maple,
admirably adapted for fine carving. some distance from the edge of the
top the smooth surface commenced to take the undulations of the surface
of water, gradually increasing in volume until the edge was reached,
where the waves seemed to flow over in an irregular line down the sides,
here and there forming panels. the three supports were composed of
female figures sculptured in wood; one supported by a dolphin suggested
the mythical origin of the harp, another was poised upon a dolphin's
back, and the third was a water nymph nestled among the rocks and spray.
the music desk contained a picture of sunrise on lake erie. all of the
carving was colored with translucent greens and blues enhancing the
graceful undulations and wave movements. the panels were all designed to
illustrate some of the most important views of the waterways of new york
state. the first represented new york harbor, the next east river
spanned by brooklyn bridge, another the hudson, with its palisades. the
panel over the rear support was a view of albany, showing the capitol on
the hill at sunset; another showed cohoes falls and the erie canal; the
next contained a picture of little falls; the last being a picture of
buffalo harbor. on the top, as a fitting finale, was a large picture
representing the american falls at niagara. underneath the front half of
the top was painted the coat of arms of the state.


the staff

the state building was at all times in charge of a competent and
obliging staff, which always stood ready to minister to the comfort and
pleasure of the guests of the empire state. honorable frank j. lefevre,
of new paltz, was superintendent. he performed the arduous duties of
directing the actions of the force and attending to a multitude of
details with cheerfulness and efficiency. he was ably assisted by george
e. cowper, of olean, the assistant superintendent.

the social functions given in the name of the state commission were
directed by mrs. norman e. mack, the lady member of the commission,
whenever she was present. in her absence the social duties fell upon
mrs. dore lyon, who invariably extended the state's hospitality with
grace and tact. the assistant hostess, mrs. f. p. applebee, won many
friends in the course of the season through her courteous treatment
toward all guests. the comfort of the commission and their house guests
was admirably provided for by miss laura macmartin, the matron.

acknowledgment is also due to those who faithfully served the commission
in the state building in various capacities throughout the exposition
period.

the state building was generally recognized as the social center of the
exposition. many functions were given throughout the season by the

chapter v

dedication day


the new york state building was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on
saturday, june twenty-fifth. the exercises were attended by governor
odell and invited guests, members of the state commission, exposition
officials, state and foreign representatives and many others.


program for dedication day

the program for the day was as follows:

  10:30 a. m. concert on plaza in front of state building by weil's band
        of st. louis

  11:30 a. m. exercises in grand hallway, william berri, vice-president
        of the commission, presiding

  invocation by the rev. carroll n. davis, dean of christ church

  8 to 11 p. m. reception given to governor and mrs. odell by the state
        commission

  music by the haskell indian band

the day opened bright and clear, the warm rays of the sun being tempered
by a cool breeze. the building was not opened to the public until the
conclusion of the band concert, which was held between 10:30 and 11:30.
as soon as the doors were opened a large audience quickly gathered to
take part in the formal exercises of the day. in the assemblage was an
interesting couple, mr. horace stowell, aged 93 years, and wife, who had
journeyed from madison, n. y., a distance of over a thousand miles, to
be present at the dedication ceremonies and to visit the fair.


the formal exercises

promptly at 11:30 william berri, vice-president of the commission,
called the assemblage to order and introduced rev. carroll n. davis, who
offered the invocation. at its conclusion mr. berri delivered his
address. the slight change in program was due to the fact that president
francis was necessarily detained for a short time.

vice-president berri said:

"governor odell, it is with very great pleasure your new york state
commission to the louisiana purchase exposition welcomes you in the new
york state building here erected upon the spot where a little over one
year ago you honored us by turning the first spadeful of earth for the
foundation.

"your commission has endeavored to carry out your expressed wishes to
provide for the people of new york who may visit this wonderful world's
fair, a building that shall fittingly represent the state of new york
and add its share with the other state buildings to beautifying the
grounds.

"we are much pleased that it is a matter of record that not only was
this building complete in every detail and its doors thrown open for
inspection on the opening day of the exposition, but also that all
exhibits under the control of your commission, in the various
departments, most of which are very much larger than ever before shown
by new york state, were ready and in place at the moment president
francis officially declared that the great st. louis exposition was open
to receive the world.

"we wish to thank president francis and all officials connected with him
in this great undertaking, for the uniform courtesy with which we have
been treated, and for the valuable assistance that has been so
generously given to us in carrying out our plans.

"it has been a most pleasurable task. we have fully accomplished what we
have sought to attain. there is nothing lacking in the realization of
our anticipations. as to whether we have acted wisely it is for you to
judge. if, as the executive head of our state, it shall please you to
commend the results we submit for your approval, this will be the
proudest day in the history of the commission."

as governor odell rose to respond to the remarks of mr. berri, he
received an ovation, for which he bowed acknowledgment several times and
finally raised his hand for silence. he spoke as follows:


address of governor odell

_"mr. president, ladies and gentlemen"_

"we are here to-day to dedicate a building which represents the interest
of new york state in this great exposition. here, during the period when
thousands shall visit these grounds, those who owe allegiance to the
empire state will find a place which will typify to them their home and
impress them, let us hope, to a greater degree with the vastness of our
state and of the position which it occupies in our commonwealth of
nations. to those who have been intrusted with the work we owe thanks
for the conception of their duty and for this magnificent edifice which,
in its strength and beauty of architecture, is symbolical of the empire
state. in every phase of our nation's history, in all that has made it
great and powerful and respected, new york has been both conservative
and wise in the aid which it offered, powerful in the resources which it
furnished in the building up of our republic. from the time when the
courage and patriotism of our forefathers wrought out the nation down to
the latest acquisition of our territory there is no page of history
which does not tell of the devotion and statesmanship of new york's
citizens.

"it is always a remarkable event in the history of the world when one
nation disposes of any part of its domain to another through peaceful
methods. war has almost always been the means through which nations have
expanded and pushed forward their boundary lines. trade requiring an
outlet has more frequently been the cause of bloodshed than almost any
other national or international question. that our country, therefore,
at an early period in its history, should have been able, through
peaceful means, to secure the vast domain beyond the mississippi is a
tribute to the statesmanlike policies of those who conceived its
purchase. true it may be that the wars of other nations aided in its
consummation, but it is also equally true that the man who was most
directly responsible for the purchase was a son of the empire state. nor
did the results of this early diplomatic victory stop here. the
principle thus established has frequently led to more peaceful methods
of adjusting questions of territorial boundary, both in our own and
other countries. it may be that much that has since been accomplished
through arbitration is but the evolution of this idea, and it may lead,
let us hope, to the time when such questions will no longer render
necessary the arbitrament of the sword.

"it was proper, therefore, that our state, in its dignity, with its
conservatism and with its intense patriotism, should be among the first
to contribute of its means to make of this exposition the grand success
which it promises. with each succeeding international exposition the
world becomes wiser, artisans more skillful, the contributions to
science and art more valuable; in a word, they raise the standard of
civilization and hasten the time when all men shall pay homage to the
ruler of the universe. as inventions are developed which make the worker
more effective, which broaden the field of usefulness, there come
responsibilities and problems which require education and discernment to
meet and solve. under the softened touch of christianity, religion and
education there should come about a universal brotherhood of man broad
enough in scope to embrace all humanity. in all the work of the world,
in all that is for the development of man, in everything that holds out
promise to the future, new york state we may justly say, if not the
leader, is at least in the fore ranks. its broad acres are rich and
fertile, and the commerce of the world enters at its ports. the
manufacturer finds willing hands with remunerative wages striving to
produce that which is necessary for our comfort and which adds so much
to the wealth of the nation. its laws are broad and ample in their
scope, with no distinction as between man and man, and beneficent in
their operation, while our citizens evince impulses which are worthy of
emulation by all those who believe in the future of our republic. we
have more of wealth and a greater population than any other state within
the union. our cities are cosmopolitan in character, made up of
representatives of all nations, but so nicely adjusted are our laws that
they are assimilated into our population and become americans among
americans, actuated by a common patriotism and a common desire for the
continued development of our land.

"in these great halls, in these magnificent buildings devoted to art, to
education, to mechanics and to agriculture, exhibits are to be found
which are on a par if they do not excel, those of other nations. the
advancement of new york, however, is but typical of every other state in
the union, in the continued prosperity of which all are equally
interested. a nation of separate states, there is no dividing line of
envy between them, no wish except for the prosperity and development of
each, a common hope for a common country. how necessary it is,
therefore, that in all that has to do with society a broad catholic
spirit should dominate and control. ours is not a country of classes,
but one of equality--a country whose aim is the education of its
citizens. it is our common object to perpetuate the principles of
american independence. anything that retards human progress, or that
would make of a man a mere machine without brains, is to be deprecated.
our object should be to encourage and to promote thrift, and to instill
into the mind of every citizen a desire for advancement. in this
direction our state will be found always in the forefront and the
evidence of her greatness will be measured rather by the intelligence of
her citizens than by mere accumulation of wealth. therefore, that which
protects labor, which encourages capital, should be the aim of modern
legislation. while we participate in the celebration of this great
national event, as we mark our progress along every line, we feel a
natural pride in all that has been done in other states, in all that has
been accomplished by other people. as we look into the future, as we
consider its possibilities, let us hope that our nation will never
forget that this government is one by the people, and that its power and
influence among the nations of the world will continue only so long as
due weight and consideration is given to the rights of individuals.
while rejoicing as citizens of new york, let us hope for the continuance
of those policies and principles which have made our nation prosperous,
and let us not forget that moderation and conservatism should be the
measure of our efforts, and all that we do shall be for the advancement
of all the people.

"the citizens of new york extend their congratulations to the people of
the west and northwest. we hope that from this great exposition there
shall come a closer communication between all the people of the earth, a
broadening of human effort, the advancement of civilization and a
growing respect for our country and our flag which will make us a power
for the good and peace of the world.

"it is a great pleasure for me to accept on behalf of the state of new
york this magnificent building, and again to congratulate you as the
president of the commission, and the architect who has wrought this
wonderful work, for the painstaking care that you have exercised in the
development of new york's interests in this great exposition."

during the address of the governor, president francis quietly entered
and was introduced at its conclusion. he was warmly received and made a
characteristic address. he paid a warm tribute to the empire state and
her chief executive, and complimented the state commission upon the work
it had performed and spoke of the new york state building as one of the
social centers of the exposition.

his remarks in part follow:

"your distinguished son, robert r. livingston, was the man who first
negotiated for the purchase of louisiana. no exposition would be
complete without a representation from the empire state. the exposition
management has already pointed with pride to the new york building, the
social functions of which have been among the marked attractions of the
exposition.

"i am here to thank new york not only for her material contribution to
the world's fair, but for the spirit her citizens have given to this
exposition.

"we of the west flatter ourselves that we have arrived at that stage of
our progress when we can invite every people on the globe to come and
see for themselves what a century of western civilization has
accomplished."

at the conclusion of the ceremonies governor odell held an informal
reception, during which mr. s. h. grover, of new york, played an organ
recital.

the evening reception

the state building was appropriately decorated for the evening reception
given in honor of governor and mrs. odell, and many hundred guests
called to pay their respects between the hours of eight and eleven. the
receiving party consisted of governor benjamin b. odell, jr., mrs.
odell, mr. and mrs. william berri, mrs. norman e. mack, mr. and mrs.
john k. stewart, mr. and mrs. john young, mrs. daniel manning, mr. frank
s. mcgraw, mr. frederick r. green, mr. john c. woodbury, and mr. william
t. van brunt, representing president harriman. the guests were presented
to the receiving party by major harrison k. bird, private secretary to
the governor. two lines of united states marines guarded the approach to
the receiving line and prevented crowding and confusion.

music was furnished by the haskell indian band and later in the evening
dancing was indulged in by many of the guests present. supper was served
at ten o'clock at small tables on the verandas, the following being the
menu:

     celery             olives               radis

new york state week


the week beginning october third was set aside by the exposition
authorities as new york week; monday, october third, being designated
"new york city day," and tuesday, october fourth, "new york state day."


new york city day

new york city day was observed with exercises in the city building on
the model street at eleven o'clock in the morning, which were presided
over by thomas w. hynes, the commissioner officially representing the
city. mayor mcclellan was represented by charles v. fornes, president of
the board of aldermen. there were also present an official delegation
representing the city. addresses were made by archbishop j. j. glennon,
of st. louis; right reverend bishop mcnamara, of new york city; walter
b. stevens, secretary, and f. j. v. skiff, director of exhibits of the
exposition; howard j. rogers, chief of department of education and
social economy, and others. luncheon was served at noon at the tyrolean
alps, and from three to five in the afternoon a reception was held in
the city building, which was attended by exposition officials, national
and state representatives, st. louis society and many new yorkers. in
the evening a sumptuous banquet was served in the town hall of the
tyrolean alps, which was presided over by commissioner hynes.


serenade to governor odell

governor odell and staff and invited guests reached st. louis monday
morning, october third. at noon the governor was tendered a serenade by
the philippine constabulary band of 100 pieces. on monday evening a
dinner was given at the state building by the new york state commission
in honor of the governor and mrs. odell, and president and mrs. francis.
owing to a death in the family, president and mrs. francis were unable
to be present. mr. d. m. houser, of the board of directors, represented
president francis. there were no formal speeches, governor odell simply
regretting that president francis could not be present.


program for new york state day

the program for new york state day was as follows:

  11 a.m. concert by the garde republicaine band, of
        paris, france, on the plaza in front of the state
        building

  12 m. formal exercises of the day in the grand entrance
        hall, col. edward lyman bill presiding
    invocation by rev. dr. william w. boyd, of st.
        louis, formerly of new york
    address of welcome by col. edward lyman bill.
    address of greeting in behalf of exposition company
        by hon. franklin ferriss

  9 to 12 p. m. reception and ball given by the new york
        state commission in honor of governor and mrs.
        odell. dancing after ten o'clock

while not marked by the presence of militia and other spectacular
features which generally accompany the celebration of a state day, the
exercises in the state building which were held at noon were most
dignified and impressive. the day opened clear and cool, and the
spacious verandas of the state building were well filled long before the
time set for the concert.


the garde republicaine band

the garde republicaine band is composed of 100 skilled musicians and is
considered by many to be the finest band in the world. no musical
organization which visited the exposition during the entire season
received more compliments or more flattering press notices than those
accorded this band. they played the following program:

  1. march, "lisbon"--l. planel
  2. overture, "la princesse jaime"--c. saint-saens
  3. fantasie on the opera "lecompte ory"--g. rossini
      soloists, mm. paradis, laforgue, joseph barthelemy,
      morfaux, couilland, fournier
  4. three celebrated menuets--
      (a) menuet--l. van beethoven
      (b) "ox" menuet--j. haydn
      (c) menuet favori--w. a. mozart
  5. march, "egyptian"--j. strauss

at the conclusion of the formal exercises they were entertained at
luncheon by the state commission. through their leader, m. gabriel
pares, they expressed hearty appreciation of the courteous treatment
accorded them by the state of new york, and attested the same by playing
a second concert in front of the state building between the hours of two
and four in the afternoon. it was worthy of note that the building of
the state of new york was the only state building at which this band
played during its entire stay at the exposition, their concerts being
invariably given either in festival hall or in the grand bandstand in
machinery gardens.


the formal exercises

at twelve o'clock the assemblage was called to order by colonel edward
lyman bill. there were present governor and mrs. odell, the governor's
staff, a joint committee of the legislature, members of the state
commission, invited guests, several representatives of the exposition
company, representatives of state and foreign commissions, and a large
audience, many of whom had journeyed all the way from new york state to
be present at the ceremonies.

the personal party of the governor consisted of governor benjamin b.
odell, jr., mrs. odell, mrs. william kelly, mrs. s.l. dawes, mrs. hall
and miss odell.

the governor's staff comprised brigadier-general nelson h. henry,
adjutant-general and chief of staff; major harrison k. bird, military
secretary; lieutenant-colonel charles h. sherrill, aide-de-camp;
lieutenant-commander alfred brooks fry, naval militia, aide-de-camp;
major charles c. davis, thirteenth regiment, aide-de-camp; major richard

aide-de-camp; first lieutenant thomas barron, seventh regiment,
aide-de-camp; first lieutenant augustus s. chatfield, eighth regiment,
aide-de-camp; first lieutenant cornelius vanderbilt, twelfth regiment,
aide-de-camp.

binghamton; hon. edwin a. merritt, potsdam; hon. robert linn cox,
buffalo; hon. thomas d. lewis, oswego.

colonel bill called upon the rev. w. w. boyd, of st. louis, formerly of
new york, to invoke the divine blessing.

dr. w. w. boyd:

"our father, we thank thee for this beautiful day and this assembly of
the loyal sons and daughters of our native state. we rejoice that thou
hast gathered us into families, and so into communities, commonwealths
and the perfect union of all the states.

"we bless thee for the history of this great state, its part in the
glorious revolution, in the preservation of the union, its development
in every branch of human industry, its material prosperity, but above
all, for its humanities, its growth in philanthropy, education and
religion.

"bless, we beseech thee, his excellency the governor, and all associated
with him in making, interpreting and executing the laws.

"bless the president, directors and all who have helped to create and
develop this marvelous exposition, especially the commissioners of the
state of new york, who have erected this splendid building, and by the
varied exhibits in the palaces of the exposition portrayed the wonderful
progress of the empire state.

"and grant, o most merciful father, that the fruits of this great
exposition may be enlarged national prosperity, international comity and
peace, and the strengthening of the ties of human brotherhood throughout
the world.

"may thy special blessing be upon the exercises of this hour; may the
words of our mouth and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in thy
sight, o lord, our strength and our redeemer. amen."

colonel bill then delivered the following address:


address of colonel bill

"on behalf of the new york state commission i extend greeting and hearty
welcome to the official representative of president francis, to governor
odell, our distinguished guests, to the sons and daughters of new york,
and to all who have honored us with their presence here to-day. it was
on this site, upon may 2, 1903, governor odell lifted the first spadeful
of earth where this beautiful structure has since been erected. upon
that occasion new york was represented by our chief executive, his
staff, and troops numbering nearly fifteen hundred men from all branches
of the military and naval service of the state. on last april thirtieth
this building, sumptuously appointed, was formally opened to the public.
i may say, with pardonable pride, that the report which the commission
made at that time showed that not only was our building complete in
every detail, but all of the state exhibits as well were ready for
inspection. the work of our commission has been along pleasant lines,
and we have been constantly stimulated by hearty support from the
exposition authorities. it is fitting that we should express our sincere
appreciation to president francis and the sterling coterie of men with
whom he is surrounded for the aid and assistance which they have so
willingly rendered this commission in every way. our governor has taken
a warm interest in new york's participation at this fair, and on many
occasions he has made manifest his desire that new york's representation
should be ample and complete in every particular. in many of the
magnificent places, such as education, agriculture, horticulture,
forestry, fish and game, mines and metallurgy, our state has collective
exhibits which show her varied resources. in this beautiful structure
will be evidenced further proof of new york's generous participation in
this great exposition. the louisiana purchase exposition has a deep
interest for new york, for one of the principal figures instrumental in
bringing about that purchase was livingston, a distinguished son of the
empire state, and it was he who negotiated the treaty and was first to
sign it. and yet the real authors of that great transaction on this side
of the ocean were neither jefferson, madison nor livingston, and i think
historians will agree with me when i say it was more the influence of
those hardy frontiersmen of kentucky who demanded free navigation for
the magnificent inland river which rolls by us in its eternal flow to
the gulf of mexico. the influence of those men, the vanguard of
civilization, could not be disregarded by those who were at the head of
our governmental affairs more than a century ago. then, the more we look
at this transaction, the more evident it is that the outcome of it was
due to that man whose shadow even now falls sharply athwart the whole
continent of europe--napoleon bonaparte. it was his ambition which threw
into the grasp of the infant republic the splendid empire out of which
have been carved twelve sovereign states and two territories. at that
time napoleon uttered one of those far-seeing expressions which is
important in its prophecy. 'perhaps,' he said, 'it will be objected to
me that the americans of two or three centuries hence may be found too
powerful for europe, but my foresight does not embrace such remote
fears. besides, we may hereafter expect rivalries among members of the
union. confederacies that are called perpetual last only until one of
the contending parties finds it is to its interests to break them. it is
to prevent the danger to which the colossal power of england subjects us
that i would provide such a remedy.' no such vision of the future came
to our american statesmen, many of whom bitterly opposed the purchase of
the louisiana territory. when the bill came up for discussion on the
floor of congress, josiah quincy, afterwards mayor of boston, and for
many years president of harvard college, said, speaking of the
incorporation in the union of the territory of louisiana: 'it appears to
me that this measure would justify revolution in this country. i am
compelled to declare it as my deliberate opinion that if this bill
passes, the bonds of this union are virtually dissolved; that the states
which compose it are free from their moral obligation, and that, as it
will be the right of all, so it will be the duty of some to prepare
definitely for a separation, amicably if they can, violently if they
must.' he said further: 'if this bill passes, it is a death blow to the
constitution.' strange words, indeed, in our ears at this time, and it
shows that the american statesmen of those days had not the imagination
of napoleon.

"what has this purchase meant to new york to have in this union this
great empire? what has it meant to the union itself to have this
splendid territory incorporated in it? it has meant for new york
prosperity and increased commerce to the people of all our land and
furnished homes for the sons and daughters of new york. the states
carved out of that great empire have all borne their share in the heat
of our national life and they have contributed immeasurably to the
nation's growth and development, and we have come in this country,
notwithstanding the immense separation and diversity of interests, to
work together under one flag, with one interest for a common country,
and this great exposition should teach not only us of the east but of
all other sections of the country that we should avoid the danger of
finding ourselves separate in sentiment from one another. in this great
western empire we all take a common interest, and the success of this
exposition redounds to the credit and honor, not only of the men who
have carried it to such successful issue, but upon the whole country. we
all shine in the reflected glory of the louisiana purchase exposition,
which shows the high-water mark of human progress. it is indeed the
greatest of all international fairs and a lasting credit to the artistic
skill of the men who planned and executed it. it is the culmination of
all that has been done in the wide expanse of territory purchased from
france in 1803, and the achievements of all nations in the world since
that day. it is a far cry from the early oriental fairs in the east,
which were perhaps the early ancestors of this great exposition, and all
honor and credit and glory is due the men who stood shoulder to shoulder
in carrying this great enterprise to such a magnificent culmination. it
represents american skill, american enterprise, american endeavor, and
its influence will be felt upon this country long after those men who
have played their successful part in this great moving drama have passed
from earth. words are inadequate to fittingly describe the beauties of
this magnificent exposition. it is individual effort as well as
concerted effort which has brought about these splendid results. it is
one of the brightest pages in american history, and what glorious
memories a perusal of these pages arouse! we can turn the pages of
recorded history from the time when the boats of the adventurous genoese
unfolded their white wings in the harbor of palos and sped across the
unknown seas to bring back upon their return evidence of the existence
of a new world far across the wide waste of waters. in fancy we picture
that sturdy band kneeling with columbus, richly attired, upon the tropic
sands, while over them floats the blood and gold banner of spain, as the
priest clothed in vestments of his office asks the blessings of almighty
god upon the land which columbus claims in the name of the house of
castile. in the background we see waving palms and dark-skinned men who
gaze with awe upon the white discoverers. in another scene we see the
cold wintry waves surge and dash around the frail craft fighting its way
across dark tempestuous seas from plymouth, the little bark tossed like
a feather here and there until she lands on that rock-bound coast known
as new england. we see that little colony--freedom's seed--germinate and
thrive; first the grain, then the tender plant, ever exposed to severe
conditions, then matured into the oak of a giant nation. we see those
brave colonists who have planted the banner of human liberty upon the
inhospitable shores push ever onward, ever extending the fringe of
civilization, struggling against disheartening obstacles, fighting wild
beasts and savage men, but pushing on with indomitable courage. we see
the historical gathering at philadelphia, resulting in that document
embodying jefferson's superb crystallization of popular opinion that
'all men are created free and equal and endowed with certain inalienable
rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness;' that american magna charta which swept away forever the will
of kings in this land. the people became the rulers and the accident of
birth carried no rank, conferred no privilege. we see the loosely joined
colonies building a nation which contained these elements of greatness
little dreamed of by those hardy pioneers who so generously gave up
their offering of blood on freedom's altar. the kaleidoscope still
turns. we see those intrepid founders of the school of liberty pushing
their lines ever onward across rivers, deserts, over mountains clad with
eternal snow until the golden shores of california gladden the eye of
our valiant explorers. then a pause, and over land and sea hang dark
clouds of fratricidal war. four long years through the valleys and over
the mountains of the southland surges the red tide of battle. the days
were dark and full of gloom, when lo! the clouds parted and the heavens
again were blue. the nation had been born anew, and on the fair pages of
her history appear no longer the dark stain of human slavery. the strong
arm of enterprise quickly washed away the red stain of war. the word
'america' had a deeper and more sacred meaning than before, and the
nation was re-established on the indestructible foundation of national
unity; the blocks were laid in the cement of fraternal esteem. still the
picture which we see revolves. across the waters of the pacific america
sweeps towards the fulfillment of her world wide destiny. the stars and
stripes wave over the palace of the kings in honolulu. still again the
nation's sword is unsheathed in the cause of human liberty, and the last
vestige of spanish power is swept from the new world. the thunder of
dewey's guns awakens us to the fact that the american banner is planted
into the far orient, there to stay forever, and under its protecting
folds manifold blessings are carried to the people of those islands
lying in the purple spheres of summer seas. while the drum of all
american progress is heard around the world, it too may be truthfully
said that the sun never sets upon the soil over which freedom's banner
proudly floats, for when the light of the dying day is fading from porto
rican hills the golden rays of the morning sun are reflected upon the
shimmering folds of old glory on the gray old battlements of manila.

"it is indeed inspiring, the history of this great nation, guided to its
ultimate issue as a stately ship is wafted over the seas to the harbor
of its destination. i wonder if in this ceaseless struggle for gold and
gain we pause long enough to study the true character of those men to
whose valorous deeds we owe so much, those men who planted the tree of
human liberty so deep that even the shock of revolution of succeeding
wars could not uproot it, those men who demanded of jefferson a free
mississippi and who made this exposition possible. all honor to those
heroes who stood shoulder to shoulder in the days which tried men's
souls, who, in the gloom and suffering of valley forge, saw in the
distance the rainbow of hope shining over the dark clouds of defeat.
they saw the light of a great nation which would serve as a beacon in
the world progress and a refuge for the persecuted of the nations of
earth. all races contributed to the founding of this beloved country.
the roster of the revolution is filled with names which show that the
liberty loving of all european nations gave up a generous offering of
blood on freedom's altar. in our veins courses blood of all nations, and
it is the healthy commingling of that blood which has produced a race of
world conquerors. it has produced the men who have made possible this
great exposition. we have been placed in the world's crucible, have been
melted in the glowing heat of a nascent life, and have been forged into
a weapon which shall carve the world. our ideals are worthy, the hopes
and aspirations of the nation devoted to justice and love; ideals which
shall be the steadfast inspirer of nations and individuals to
uprightness, to justice and to honor."

the presiding officer then expressed regret at the unavoidable absence
of president francis on account of bereavement in his family. he
introduced judge franklin ferriss, general counsel to the louisiana
purchase exposition company, who delivered the following address:


address of judge ferriss

"i regret extremely, for your sake and his, that the brilliant man who
stands at the head of this exposition cannot be here to-day to greet you
in person. still i must admit that i am not unmindful of the fact that i
owe to his misfortune and yours the very great privilege of appearing
before you to extend a welcome to the people of my native state.

"the president of the exposition bids me say to you that there has been
no occasion on these grounds--that there will be none in the future--in
which he would more gladly participate than this.

"the exposition management feels under peculiar obligations to the state
of new york. we are indebted largely to her prompt and liberal
co-operation for the high stand which the exposition has taken. we are
indebted to the governor, to the new york commission, to the gracious
hostesses of this building, to the splendid woman who has, with rare
tact and dignity, co-operated with the exposition as president of the
board of lady managers.

"in the building of this exposition, science, invention, art,
manufacture, the field, the forest, the mine, the air and the water have
contributed their choicest treasures. how well we have succeeded in
presenting them you must judge. but i wish to say to you that no matter
how high a standard we have reached, still more important than all else
is the representation upon these grounds of our splendid american man
and womanhood. no man can walk about this plateau of states, view these
beautiful structures, see the people coming together from the north and
the south, the east and the west, uniting in common loyalty and respect
for our institutions, without feeling his heart swell with pride and
gratitude.

"it is no disparagement to our sister states, for me, a loyal son of new
york, to say that it is most fitting that the empire state should be
pre-eminent here also in the beauty of her building, the character of
her exhibits and the magnificent representation of her people.

"i am proud of the state of new york--proud of her history, her
scholars, her statesmen, her soldiers--proud of her material
prosperity--proud of the great metropolis through whose gates thunders
the commerce of the united states.

"i love the state of new york--her broad and fertile valleys, her
stately rivers, the lakes which glisten like jewels on her bosom, her
mountains which rear their tops to the clouds; but most of all i love
the quiet life of the country home--the honesty and industry of the
plain people.

"our old home! who can forget it? the great barn with its huge beams and
fragrant mows of hay--the sparkling brook whose shining shallows bathed
my naked feet--the broad meadow with its fence corners of luscious
berries--the old schoolhouse, whose desks are impressed with generations
of jack-knives! was there ever so sweet a draught as that which we drew
from the shining depths of the old well?

"and yet the country boy grew restless. with his ear to the ground, he
heard the distant hum of industry. he heard the tramp of a million feet
in the great cities. he felt that the battle of life was on, and, that
he must take his place in the struggle. and so he turned his back upon
the old home.

"ah! how many grave faced fathers and tender, sweet faced mothers have
watched their boys, one by one, go out into the world, and have turned
back in solitude, cheered by an occasional visit, an occasional letter,
to wait until their days should be fulfilled. and how many of us must
now say that their days have been fulfilled, and that a simple stone
marks their last resting place in the village churchyard.

"what have we gained by this? contentment? they had it. respect of our
fellowmen? they had it. success in life? they had it. true, their
fortunes were small--and yet they had no clutching fear that
speculation, fraud or treachery would rob them of the fruit of a life's
toil. and they had an abiding faith that there would be provision for
the years to come. aye, that there would be provision for the last
journey to that land, where, according to their simple faith: 'the
wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.'

"i will yield to no man in loyalty to the state of my adoption; but who
can chide me if my heart clings to the home of my childhood, to the
graves of my forefathers?

"if we, who have left the old home to build a new one in the west, can
be faithful to the traditions of our childhood--if we can bequeath to
our children the lessons of industry, honesty and economy which our
fathers gave to us--we shall do more to honor the state of new york than
we could do by rearing marble to the skies."

the presiding officer then introduced honorable benjamin b. odell, jr.;
governor of the state, who received a great ovation, it being some time
before the governor was able to proceed with his remarks. his speech was
punctuated with liberal applause.

he said:


address of governor odell

"the diplomacy which led up to the acquisition of the louisiana
territory furnishes one of the most interesting incidents in the world's
history. the establishment of a republic devoted to the interests of,
and affording liberty of conscience and freedom of action to its
citizens, was an experiment in government which could not have succeeded
if any restraint had been placed upon that liberty, or if its
constitution had not been broad enough to meet the demands of a growing
country. from the settlement of america down to the revolutionary war
sanguinary strife had been the lot of the american people. the thrifty
dutch and the stolid determined anglo-saxon sought not in this country a
mere temporary home, for, unlike the spaniards, their dream was not of
gold, but rather their hope was for a liberty so broad and catholic in
its character that it would grow with succeeding years and make certain
that peace they had sought for in vain in the land of their birth.

"the earlier colonial and indian wars had drawn upon the resources and
heroism of our forefathers. hardship and toil had imbued them with a
consciousness of their strength and instilled into them that spirit of
independence which enabled them, after long years of strife, to
establish our republic. it was this people, after having gained their
independence, in the belief that foreign complications were forever at
an end, who, at the close of the revolution, turned their attention to
peaceful pursuits and endeavored to meet every requirement of a growing
country. with characteristic skill and industry they began the
development of those tremendous resources of our country, the measure of
which is almost beyond human conception. here, under liberal laws and
wise administration, the people found that which had been heretofore
lacking in the government of the world. invention had not yet made
possible the intercommunication facilities which we of the present
enjoy. upon water transit, therefore, they were obliged to depend for an
outlet for the commerce of their western territory. the barriers which
were sought to be interposed to communication over the mighty river
which rises in the northwest brought forth vigorous protests from those
who had just begun to cultivate its fertile fields. angry passions were
aroused, and the people of our country who had been so successful in
carving out the republic demanded that this barrier should be removed.
livingston and monroe, clothed only with power to effect a treaty which
should insure this right of transit, with no possible opportunity of
quick communication with their government, took upon themselves the
responsibility which brought to a successful consummation the
relinquishment of this vast territory.

"thus was brought to the people of the united states a question which
had never been contemplated by the framers of the constitution. that
instrument had been the production of the wisest men of the times. they
had successfully met the problem of drawing into an indissoluble union
the thirteen states, many of which were acting under peculiar laws which
were contrary to the declaration of independence, under which the
battles for freedom had been fought and won. while there was authority
for the admission of new states, there was no constitutional permission
for the purchase of territory. the power of the federal government to
perform acts of sovereignty had not yet been passed upon, and there was
grave doubt as to the wisdom of ratifying the treaty without a
constitutional amendment. when we look over the results which have
followed this expansion of our country, when we calculate our manifest
growth in population, in wealth and in industry, all of these appear
insignificant beside the result which was accomplished in showing to the
world that we were living under a constitution broad enough in its
provisions to be so interpreted as to insure success to popular
government. that jefferson and his advisers acted wisely in so
construing their power at that time is undoubted. if there were no other
achievements of that wonderful administration, then this alone would
suffice to make it a memorable one.

"doubt, lack of courage and insincere opposition are always the refuge
of a coward. here was a nation demanding that which was necessary for
its trade, desirous of reaching a solution through peaceful means if
possible, but determined to acquire it at all hazards if necessary.
there was no question as to the consent of those whom we took over, and
to whom we gave the protection of our flag, or as to nice points of
constitutionality, when the greater object in view was the onward
progress of civilization, the building up of hope and the fulfillment of
our destiny as a nation, to perpetuate those principles which mean so
much in the redeeming of the world. the exigencies of a later war found
a precedent in the courage of jefferson and enabled lincoln to wipe from
the escutcheon of state the blot of slavery which had too long tarnished
it.

"that the acquisition of this territory was accomplished through
peaceful means rather than by bloodshed was another triumph for
civilization. while wars have come since, and may come in the future,
the plan of arbitration which has been adopted so generally by this and
other nations may perhaps have had its inception in this peaceful
solution of a burning and important question to this country. our union
now is one that is composed of commonwealths bound together by all that
means common interest, the common weal and common protection of all the
people. it leads to the hope that when the representatives of all of the
states have decreed by a majority that which is for the best interest of
the whole country, then these questions should no longer be the subject
of partisanship or party differences, but the government should have the
loyal support of all who believe in america and her future. the same
laws govern us, the same protection should be and is accorded to every
citizen, and there is no individual or isolated community that does not
share in the prosperity of all others whose interests are on the same
plane of equality. for a time natural advantages may unduly favor one
section of the country, but the accumulation of wealth brings about the
development of the natural resources by which other sections are built
up, and their people share in the general prosperity. our state perhaps
has benefited more through the development of the west and the northwest
territory than almost any other commonwealth. the natural valleys which
permitted the building of the erie canal and the connection of the great
lakes with the harbor of new york brought this territory in close
communication with the atlantic seaboard. the growing demands of the
world led to the cultivation of the fertile fields of the west, the
development of the mines and the building up of cities and manufactures,
until to-day we have other ports whose facilities have been increased by
the improvement of waterways and the building of thousands and thousands
of miles of railroad. while there may be an apparent decrease in some
localities and a corresponding benefit in others, yet so intimate are
our connections and associations that the prosperity of one, instead of
being a menace to the growth of any other locality, really aids in
building it up. so diversified are our interests, so skillful our
people, that we may compare the whole union to a great workshop, one
vast cultivated field of industry, all laboring, not for the advancement
of separate cities or localities, but for the continued growth of our
common country.

"it is only through ignorance that people have a misconception of these
truths. the development of the human mind is no less important than the
development of the physical condition of man. his education, therefore,
is a paramount duty of the state, and his protection against the
weakening of his physical condition is equally important. that
legislation has recognized these facts is shown in laws, not only of the
nation, but of each individual state, which seek to guard and protect
the youth against unwise labor, which seek to instill into his mind that
intelligence which comes only from wise and broad educational
facilities. every able bodied citizen of our country is an asset, and
those who through weakness, however painful the admission may be, are
incapacitated from labor, must be entered upon the debit side of the
national ledger. therefore, the laws that guard against burdensome toil,
too long hours of labor, and against ignorance, are not only
humanitarian in their character, but are best calculated to promote the
interest of all the people. in the division of society, those who labor
and those who represent capital should always be in accord, and the
demands of either should never trespass upon the rights of the other. it
is too frequently the case that through misunderstanding of our laws and
the higher economical conditions that friction does arise between these
two great elements of society. the right of every man to sell his
products or his labor in the best market is unquestioned, and any
interference with this principle of sound government is a menace to the
republic itself. we are reaching a point in our history when
conservative and wise judgment must prevail, and the common sense of the
people dictates such a solution of these problems as will meet every
demand that is in harmony with sound government. our own state has taken
long steps in advance upon these questions, and to us with whom these
differences more frequently occur the people will look for wise
deliberations and conclusions.

"every man should be a part of the government. he should feel it to be
as much his duty to respond to civic responsibilities as do those living
under a monarchy, whose early tuition instills in them the belief that
they owe the best part of their lives to the military service of their
government. as they are undeterred by fear of death or disaster, so
should our young men be undeterred from entering public life by calumny,
villification and abuse, which they see too frequently and too unjustly
bestowed upon others.

"new york is here to-day by its official representatives to testify
first to its loyalty to the purposes for which this exposition was
conceived; to show the people of the west that in their progress we are
interested, and that to them we look for such returns in dividends upon
the stock of patriotism as will give to our nation men of energy, of
right impulses. to you we owe much, and from you we expect much. our
efforts will be to aid you in every laudable undertaking, to stand
behind you in all that means the prosperity of our common country. you
have here an exposition of which you may be justly proud. nothing like
it has ever been known in the annals of the world. skilled workmen from
all parts of the earth are here to aid in its success. here you witness
not only the steady progress that has been made in the sciences, the
arts, and agriculture, but you have before you also exhibits from some
of the possessions which have recently come under our control. we may
study here some of the problems which demand solution at the hands of
the american people. our flag has been planted in a far-off land, and we
must face responsibilities which it would be cowardly to shirk. a
message has come to us as to all other nations, to do the master's
bidding and to spread christianity and civilization into the remotest
parts of the earth. to us have been intrusted duties that have cost us
the blood of some of the bravest men of the north and of the south, of
the east and west. here we may see something of that which has been
accomplished, as well as a presentation of those conditions which it is
our duty to correct. it is our privilege to give to others the same
liberty which we enjoy ourselves, to establish some form of government
such as ours whenever these people are ready for it, and it is our duty
to protect them in their weakness until they are prepared for it. it was
the dream of our forefathers that our country should be confined between
these two magnificent oceans, but despite these hopes in later years
additional responsibilities have come, which the american people are too
proud to shirk and too courageous to abandon. there is no one who has
seen the progress which is here represented who does not believe that
the work for civilization which is ours to perform has already had such
an impetus that the time will come when we shall bless those who had the
courage to stand for it against those who demanded another solution of
this important question. to our credit be it said, that no true american
demands the surrender of these possessions, and that the only question
of difference between the people of our country is whether they shall be
given their independence now, or when they are in a condition to enjoy
it.

"this exposition stands, not only as a monument to our progress, but to
our united and determined effort to take a prominent part in all that
means the advancement of mankind and the prosperity of the whole world.
we owe that which we are at present to the devotion and heroism of the
men of the past, and to protect and guard the inheritance which has come
to us should be our aim. to be broad and conservative in our conception
of our duties and responsibilities should be our purpose. to instill
into the minds of our youth a determination to meet every question with
true american courage should be our object. every effort that makes for
the good of humanity is a fitting tribute to that national policy which
has taught us that there is no responsibility too great for our citizens
to bear, and that in the onward progress of civilization america
recognizes her duty and will not fail in its performance."

at the conclusion of the governor's address the benediction was
pronounced by the rev. w. w. boyd, after which governor odell held a
public reception, shaking hands with several hundred people, who pressed
forward to greet him. during the progress of the reception mr. s. h.
grover, of new york city, rendered an organ recital. luncheon was served
the governor and party in the offices of the commission, and the
afternoon was devoted to sight seeing.


the evening reception

in the evening was held the grand reception and ball in honor of
governor and mrs. odell. six thousand invitations had been issued for
the function, those invited including the president of the united states
and his cabinet, judges of the united states supreme court, united
states army and navy officers, governors of all the states, new york
state officers, members of the new york state legislature, judges of the
court of appeals and appellate division and supreme court, exposition
officials, members of the national commission, members of state and
foreign commissions, the board of lady managers and many prominent
citizens of the empire state and st. louis. in spite of the fact that
the day assigned to the state of new york, a year before by the
exposition company, fell upon the date of the greatest festival of all
the year in st. louis, viz., the veiled prophets' ball, which is similar
to the mardi gras festival at new orleans, it did not affect the
attendance at the reception in the least, many people attending both
functions. throughout the evening the capacity of the building was taxed
to the utmost by those who came to enjoy new york's proverbial
hospitality.

the exterior of the building and the grounds were illuminated on a
lavish scale by the pain pyrotechnic company, of new york city. the
entire building was outlined by means of thousands of fairy lamps, and
many strings of japanese lanterns were festooned from the roof line to
the veranda balustrade. fairy lamps were used in profusion about the
grounds, forming unique figures, and at various points spelled the words
"new york." at no other function during the entire exposition were such
elaborate illuminations attempted on the part of any state commission.
the interior decorations consisted of the national and exposition
colors, gracefully wound here and there about the pillars, supplemented
by festoons of smilax, which was used in profusion in the entrance
hallway. special music for the event was furnished by fancuilli's band,
of new york city, and schoen's orchestra, of st. louis, which were
stationed respectively in the south and north galleries of the grand
entrance hall.


the receiving party

the receiving line was stationed at the foot of the grand staircase, the
guests entering at the south portal of the building and approaching
through the reception rooms.

receiving with the governor and mrs. odell were mrs. norman e. mack,
colonel and mrs. edward lyman bill, mr. and mrs. john c. woodbury, mr.
and mrs. frank s. mcgraw, mr. frederick r. green, mrs. daniel manning,
hon. s. frederick nixon, mrs. dore lyon and hon. james t. rogers. the
guests were presented to the governor by major harrison k. bird, his
military secretary, two lines of united states marines guarding the
approach to the receiving party. the governor's military staff,
resplendent in vari-colored uniforms, formed a line directly in front of
the receiving party, and, while adding eclat to the occasion, prevented
any crowding about the receiving line.

supper was served at eleven o'clock at small tables upon the verandas.
the following was the menu:

  radishes         celery        olives
      salted almonds      bonbons
oysters a la paulette      chicken salad
           assorted sandwiches
      ice cream        petit fours
lemonade         coffee      claret punch

dancing began at ten o'clock and continued until the wee sma' hours.


concluding function

the final event of state week was a breakfast given by the state
commission on wednesday noon in honor of governor and mrs. odell, and
mrs. daniel manning, president of the board of lady managers. the
breakfast was perfectly informal, no set addresses being delivered.

the functions of the entire period were voted by one and all to have
been most successful in every respect, and new york again proved its
right to the title of a most gracious and generous host.

chapter vii

brooklyn day


one of the last special days to be observed during the exposition was
brooklyn day, the exercises of which were held on november fifteenth. as
one of the speakers on the occasion aptly said, it was the only day
throughout the exposition period which was formally set apart by the
exposition management in honor of a political division less than a
municipality. a special train bearing a large delegation of
representative brooklynites arrived in st. louis monday, november
fourteenth. although the date was late in the season, the weather was
ideal, and everything was done for the pleasure and comfort of the
visitors. the ceremonies were divided between the new york state
building and the new york city building, upon the model street, and
consisted of exercises at 11:30 a.m., followed by a luncheon at one
o'clock at the new york state building, and a reception at the new york
city building from eight to ten in the evening.


the program

the program for the formal exercises in the new york state building was
as follows

  address of welcome, william berri, vice-president, new york state
      commission

  address, hon. j. edward swanstrom, on behalf of the committee of one
      hundred

  permanent chairman, colonel william hester, president of the brooklyn
      eagle

  response, hon. charles a. schieren, ex-mayor of brooklyn

  oration, hon. thomas p. peters, editor of the brooklyn times

  aeolian organ recital

promptly at 11:30 a. m. the assemblage was called to order by
vice-president william berri, who, in behalf of the state commission,
extended a cordial welcome to all present. he then called upon j. edward
swanstrom, who made brief remarks in behalf of the committee of one
hundred.

at the conclusion of mr. swanstrom's remarks, colonel william hester was
installed as permanent chairman. upon taking the chair colonel hester
said:


colonel hester's remarks

"i am very sensible of the honor conferred upon me, but will be unable
to fulfill the duties, except in a most perfunctory way. it is very much
to be regretted that the honorable martin w. littleton is not able to be
with us to-day. as the official head of the government of the borough,
he was to have presided on this occasion. in his absence major peter j.
collins, who was at the head of an important department, will respond
for his chief. i now introduce to you major collins."


speech of major collins

"_your honor, mr. francis, and ladies and gentlemen:_ in responding
as the representative of the administration of the borough of brooklyn,
i feel that you must realize the unenviable position i occupy of
appearing on such brief notice and of acting as the mouthpiece of our
president, the hon. martin w. littleton. mr. littleton instructs me to
convey his most sincere regrets to your honor, to mr. francis and to the
ladies and gentlemen constituting the committee of one hundred, on his
enforced absence on this occasion. as some of you are aware, there has
been an election in this land. previous to this election there was
carried on what some of us supposed was a political campaign. this
campaign engaged the interest of every worthy citizen and public and
private affairs of business have been neglected to some extent as a
consequence. in the business of the borough mr. littleton is confronted
with a vast accumulation of matters of greatest importance to brooklyn,
both in the local work and in the various boards and committee meetings
in manhattan, and he has reluctantly concluded that his absence from the
city at this time would amount to an almost criminal neglect of his
duty. he asks me to convey to you the congratulations and good wishes of
the many thousands of our people who are unable to be with us to-day.
brooklyn has had a deep sympathy with your fair city in this tremendous
enterprise, and has watched with keen interest and satisfaction your
success in overcoming the many difficulties that lay in your way.
brooklyn herself has awakened from her sleep of almost ten years, and
the sound of the hammer and the saw and the ring of the trowel are heard
on every hand. owing to the enterprise, energy and self-sacrificing
efforts of many of the men who are with us to-day, she is astonishing
the country by the wonderful increase in population. brooklyn can no
longer be regarded as the bedroom of manhattan, for manhattan is rapidly
becoming only the workshop of brooklyn; we can no longer be regarded as
the little brother of manhattan, for we are rapidly becoming a very big
brother. consequently, ladies and gentlemen of st. louis, we feel
qualified to appreciate the satisfaction and joy you may justly feel in
this your hour of triumph, and we extend to you the right hand of
fellowship and congratulate you on this wonderful creation of yours,
that must go down in history as the greatest exposition in the history
of mankind."

mayor wells was unavoidably detained by an important engagement. the
chairman then introduced mr. schieren, and in doing so said:

"this is no fairy story, yet i will commence it that way. once upon a
time we of brooklyn had a city all to ourselves. we were proud of our
city and very desirous that it should be well governed, and were careful
in the selection of men to fill its highest office, and thus it came to
pass that one of our most successful efforts in that direction was the
choice for mayor of our city of the gentleman whom i shall now present
to you, ex-mayor charles a. schieren."

mr. schieren was warmly received and spoke as follows:


address of ex-mayor schieren

"in the name of the brooklyn delegation i thank you sincerely for your
cordial greeting and the hearty welcome extended to us. we fully
appreciate your kind hospitality. we have come here to enjoy this
glorious exposition which already has attained such a great fame. its
magnificence and grandeur, both as to the magnitude of its buildings and
their exhibits, is a surprise to every visitor. you may be proud of your
achievements.

"this exposition seems to exceed all others held in this country, and in
many respects those held in the world.

"the centennial exposition of philadelphia, commemorating the foundation
of our government, gave our people the first idea of the extent and
scope of our labor-saving machinery and the advance made in the
manufacture of our american goods. it stimulated the manufacturing
interests in our country.

"the columbian exposition at chicago commemorated the discovery of
america. it was noted for its excellent foreign exhibits. it gave our
people an opportunity to compare the products of america with those of
other nations. the so-called white city had a peculiar charm and made a
deep impression upon every one. it seemed a perfect dream, ever to be
remembered. people declared that it could not be excelled, but hardly a
decade has passed when the enterprising, energetic citizens of the
commercial metropolis of the great southwest arranged another world's
fair to commemorate the historical events of the famous louisiana
purchase, even upon a larger scale and overshadowing all others in this
country. we may exclaim justly--will there ever be another exposition
greater and more important than the one just about to close?

"we seem to marvel at nothing in this progressive age. we always wonder
what other marvellous inventions may be in store for us to necessitate
another exposition upon a gigantic scale, to be held somewhere in this
country. perhaps within another decade, when the isthmian canal is
finished, the golden stream which will connect the waters of the pacific
and atlantic oceans, we may celebrate at the national capital city the
greatest event of the twentieth century, bringing to the commerce of the
world peace and plenty. at the same time we may hope to celebrate the
establishment of our american merchant marine, the one thing needed to
carry our american products and goods into the harbors of the world,
floating the stars and stripes now so seldom witnessed upon the ocean
vessels. this country seems to forge ahead at a rapid pace, not only in
its material wealth, but in everything that tends to the happiness of
our people, even the humblest citizens sharing in the general
prosperity. every section has cause to rejoice--the south with its
cotton, the north with its financial resources, the west with its farm
products, the east with its industries, all seem to participate in the
general welfare of the country. in conclusion let me thank you again for
the courtesy extended to our people, and we wish you great success in
this stupendous enterprise."

at the conclusion of mr. schieren's remarks the presiding officer said:
"for many years the _brooklyn times_ was owned and edited by the
late mr. bernard peters. he was a man of strict integrity, high moral
ideals, and a forceful writer. the editorial chair of the _times_
is now occupied by his son, thomas p. peters, a worthy son of a worthy
sire. ladies and gentlemen, i take pleasure in introducing to you the
orator of the day, mr. thomas p. peters."

mr. peters was greeted with hearty applause as he arose. his oration in
part follows:


oration of mr. peters

"to speak a word for brooklyn at this time, i was not the first choice
of the committee of arrangements. unanimously that honor was assigned to
one of brooklyn's favorite sons. but sickness of a most serious nature
overtook him only a few days ago, and after a brief illness, he was
early last wednesday morning called to his final rest. although upon
pleasure bent, our hearts are sorrowful because of this loss to
brooklyn.

"joseph c. hendrix had been prominent in brooklyn life a quarter of a
century, prominent enough to have been nominated at one time for mayor
of the old city by one of the great parties. he served brooklyn for many
years as president of its board of education; was its postmaster, and
also represented one of its districts in the halls of congress. of
recent years he had withdrawn from public life and devoted himself to
the financial world. there he soon assumed a commanding position as bank
president, and his organizing abilities were constantly in demand. he
was one of brooklyn's great men, and i regret that he is not here to-day
to fill the position for which he was so well fitted. our borough is
rightly in deep bereavement because of the taking off of this, a
faithful servant.

"this party of brooklynites has come over 1,000 miles to celebrate at
this magnificent exposition a day set apart for itself. we come not from
a sovereign state. neither do we come from an independent city. we come
from but part of a great city. i will venture to claim that brooklyn day
at the st. louis exposition will be the only day set apart for any
municipal body holding a place by law of less dignity than that of a
city. why, then, does brooklyn send us out to make her name known here
and to extend her greetings to st. louis? because for years brooklyn was
a city, and with more independent citizens to the total population than
were to be found in any other part of the known world, and she is still
true to her history. she had then a spirit that was the very
personification of municipal patriotism. she could tear down a dishonest
political rascal with greater celerity than any other city in the land.
she kept her two great parties equally balanced; each a foil to the
other, each a stimulant to the other for good government, and upon the
average she enjoyed better service than american cities usually obtain.

"it is almost seven years since brooklyn lost her cityhood. during that
time she has been a dependent borough within the great city of new york.
many thought that when that transition took place brooklyn would lose
her old-time spirit, her pride would be humbled and she would sink into
the slough of despair, but we are here to-day to make known to these
united states that brooklyn's old-time courage is as high, her spirit is
as heavily charged with municipal energy and her pride is the same pride
as of old.

"brooklyn is a peculiar community. she differs from all others. the wits
have long fed upon her. general horace porter has called her a city of
4,000,000, 1,000,000 of whom are alive. another has said that there are
two places to which every dead new yorker goes, either to heaven or to
hades and to brooklyn. he may escape one or the other of the two former.
he cannot escape the latter. simeon ford has declared that brooklyn lies
midway between the quick and the dead, midway between reckless,
extravagant and wicked old new york and sober, sombre and serene
greenwood. mckinley ran for president upon the issue of the full dinner
pail. the students of princeton college recently asserted that roosevelt
was running upon the issue of a full baby carriage. the president must
have secured his inspiration from the manner in which the cartoonists
always pictured the brooklyn man, behind the perambulator. we ourselves
recognize that brooklyn is peculiar and unusual. her like is not known
to the world. that fact is proved to an extent by my former assertion,
that brooklyn is the only community without municipal rank that will
have here a day of her own. the fact that we are here in body and that
she is here in spirit clearly shows that the old courage is still in her
heart. brooklyn may be only a borough, she may be only an 'abutment for
bridges,' as president littlejohn once feared she would become, but she
is to-day the same independent brooklyn she was back in her cityhood,
and she is as proud of the things that make her great as many of the
cities of the things that make them merely flashy.

"her former spirit lives; it lives because since consolidation brooklyn
has assumed a commanding place in the councils of the greater city.
brooklyn has chosen as her three borough presidents men of force, who
have been recognized as leaders by all the boroughs. at first the
borough government was a mockery of a government. it was only a
government in name. our first president, edward m. grout, chafed under
its restraint. he demanded that the boroughs be allowed a voice in city
affairs, and that local improvements be given into the charge of borough
officials. to him the state legislature listened, and his successor in
that office found himself with something beside the shadow of power, and
his administration was a marvel to brooklyn in what it achieved. other
boroughs looked on in envy, while j. edward swanstrom set a pace so
rapid that its like will be difficult to produce. our first president,
mr. grout, became the comptroller in the second administration of the
greater city. the comptrollership of new york city is as important as
that of secretary of the united states treasury. brooklyn was then and
is yet the dominant force in the life of the metropolis. the entire city
recognized mr. grout to be a man acquainted with even the minutest
details of the city's government. brooklyn's place at the table of the
board of estimate was a commanding one with swanstrom and grout in their
seats, and to-day her representation there is equally good. mr. grout is
still there. in the place of mr. swanstrom sits mr. martin w. littleton,
and by him the name of brooklyn has been made famous from ocean to
ocean, and throughout the entire south, for in him brooklyn has a
mouthpiece that thrills, and through him she speaks with a tongue of
eloquence.

"since consolidation brooklyn has been the second borough in point of
population and of wealth, but in statesmanship, in oratory and in
achievement she has stood pre-eminent. and while many believed that
after consolidation she would lose her independent spirit, she has
rather increased her old pride in herself, and this pride has been
fostered and strengthened because of the worthy sons who have
represented her in the government of the great city of new york, two of
whom we have brought with us, that st. louis, at times herself deceived
by those she trusted, may look upon their like for once at least. loyal
to brooklyn have been grout, swanstrom and littleton, and thus inspired,
has brooklyn proved loyal to herself and faithful to her traditions.

"brooklyn is a gigantic borough. she is three times as large as buffalo,
the home of the pan-american exposition. she is twice as large as st.
louis, the home of the present exposition. brooklyn territorially is
large enough and properly adapted to hold a population of 7,000,000, and
still remain less congested than the present borough of manhattan.
brooklyn is devoid of many of the characteristics that mark other great
cities. she is almost totally lacking in hotel life. a city of one-tenth
her population would have more hotels. but municipal greatness never
rested upon hotel life. it breeds corpulence, not courage. it
discourages the rearing of children, a thriving industry in brooklyn.
brooklyn has not the wealth in proportion to her size that she should
have. brooklyn sat for long years under the shadow of old new york,
contributing to the wealth of the metropolis, but obtaining nothing in
return. her population contributed to the real estate values upon
manhattan island. her factories and forges made many of the fortunes
that were spent across the east river. only since consolidation have we
received any dividends upon that ever increasing investment. we now pay
$14,000,000 into the city treasury and take $17,000,000 out annually.
brooklyn has often been described as the bedroom of old new york. the
description was apt, for brooklyn has always been a city of homes, a
city of those of moderate means, a city of respectability. brooklyn has
never been able to boast of her wealth, as other cities, nor has she had
to blush for her poverty and depravity as some other cities have.

"she has, however, been able to vaunt herself in the matter of those
things which by nature are companions of the home. she has always been
noted for her great churches, and has had the finest pulpit orators of
the day, and now she is as strong in that direction as she ever was in
the past. her private schools have been known far and wide, while so
long as she controlled her public schools, they, too, stood extremely
high. since consolidation they have fallen somewhat behind the march. in
dividing government among the boroughs, mr. grout achieved much. where
the greatest good was done was where centralization was left with the
least sway. in school matters centralization rules absolutely, and to
that extent the schools have been forcibly drawn away from the people,
and the development has lain in the direction of complexity of
educational system, rather than in that of perfecting the children in
the rudiments of scholarship. of late years we have taught our boys how
to sew, even if we did neglect their spelling. this increases the number
of special teachers, adds to the city's bills, but enables the school
superintendents to read splendid reports of new and special courses when
they attend pedagogic conventions. your exposition loaded new york's
educational authorities with medals and prizes and honorable mentions. i
would not censure you for this. no men ever worked harder for such
honors. the trouble is they work too hard over frills and neglect the
essentials. were your judges to-day to hold an examination among our
grammar scholars upon the three subjects, reading, writing and
arithmetic, i am inclined to believe that you would send hurry orders
for the return of many of those prizes.

"in school matters brooklyn is at a loss no further than are the other
boroughs of the greater city. she is at a loss because mr. grout's
advice was not taken. in short, we so highly prize our sewers, our
streets and our pavements that we directed that they be given directly
into our own charge and under our own borough president, and then we
held our children in such light esteem that we surrendered them into the
keeping of a centralized board of education, which is in turn in the
keeping of the board of superintendents, in which body brooklyn has but
a small voice. it has reminded me of those people who personally care
for their own dogs and horses and leave their children to servants and
hired tutors. the system has been wrong. the wrong system has been made
top-heavy. the results have been poor.

"brooklyn has developed the home life of america to a greater extent
than any other city has done. she has few palaces. she has few hovels.
she has a great army of american mothers and fathers that are bringing
up the next generation of men and women, and she is rearing them in
thousands of comfortable homes, where body develops with mind and where
the spiritual welfare is an important factor.

"brooklyn has a park system of which she is proud to-day, and of which
she will grow prouder. in prospect park she has a jewel, in the very
heart of the community. in forest park she has a promise of great future
development. that new park lies upon high ground overlooking a vast
section of the borough and exhibiting to the eye the bay of jamaica and
the ocean beyond. forest park is richly endowed by nature, and it will
in the days to come be in beauty above either prospect or central.
brooklyn has great driveways leading to the ocean along her harbor front
and out into long island, and she has laid out many small parks and is
still engaged upon that work.

"in library matters brooklyn to-day is well supplied. the system is most
extensive and has been rapidly developed. it is another indication of
what can be done when a department is decentralized. the brooklyn public
library is under the control of brooklyn men. the board of estimate
makes it an annual allowance. andrew carnegie gave to brooklyn
$1,600,000 for library construction. with that money twenty branch
libraries are to be erected in time. five are up; one is in operation.
to-day there are over twenty branch libraries; most of them are in
rented quarters, and they circulate over one million books a year among
the people.

"as another indication of the life of brooklyn brief reference should be
made to the institute of arts and sciences, the great college of those
beyond school years. it has been referred to as the intellectual bargain
counter of brooklyn. it offers at very moderate prices literary,
historical, musical instruction and entertainment and lectures in all
the sciences. it is well supported, and the city is building it a
central building that will be the mecca of the ambitious and the
cultured. no other city in the land supports such an institution, and it
is a great credit to us.

"brooklyn's spirit is due in a great measure to the nature of the press
that caters to her. her newspapers are intensely local in character.
they give to her institutions such support as is not given to the
institutions of any other city in the united states. it is this that has
encouraged an intelligent and independent breadth of mind in brooklyn.
she keeps alive the old new england custom of a close watch over her
government and of a constant discussion of all public questions.
englishmen are noted for their unremitting guard of their personal
rights. they are not to be compared in this with brooklynites who, in
spite of a callous railroad system, still persist in demanding their
rights.

"her press has called into being all over brooklyn numerous boards of
trade and taxpayers' associations, and they, encouraged by the attention
given to them, devote themselves to their neighborhoods. edmund burke
referred to the journalists as a fourth estate. aptly might we regard
these trade boards as a second government. highly are they respected.
many reforms, especially in transportation matters, have they achieved.

"i have outlined to you some of the features of brooklyn life. she is in
truth the place where the home life of greater new york is developed,
where it may be seen in its simple beauty adorned with its rugged
virtue. i have not boasted of her rich men, but of her intellectual
gifts; not of her social leaders, but of her clear-minded men and women;
not of her wealth, but of her mental attainments. it is from such a
community that we come to-day to write upon your visitors' book the name
of brooklyn. in our way we are as proud of our homes as was the old
roman matron of her two sons, although we may be as poorly decked with
tawdry jewels as she was. we are as proud of our independence in
politics as philadelphia should be ashamed of her regularity. boston is
credited with being the athens of america. brooklyn deserves the title,
but would leave to boston her pedantic ways. we are sincere in our
speech and simple in our faith, and when we say we rejoice in st. louis'
success, are glad to be here and are honored in having a day set aside
for us, we but echo the sentiments that our hearts suggest."

at the conclusion of the oration the chairman introduced henry sanger
snow, ll.d., who read the following original poem:


poem of dr. snow

                       i

  hail! city of the west, from ocean's strand
    afar we bring thee greeting. at thy gate,
  wide-thrown in welcome, gathered nations stand
    and praise the deed ye grandly celebrate!
  the imperial star that rose from eastern seas,
    marking the new-born nation in the west,
  rides in _thy_ zenith now--by slow degrees
    the march of empire takes its westward quest--
    and over scene more fair, sure star could never rest!

                      ii

  worthy thy festival of that high deed--
    louisiana's treaty--greatest act
  of all that came from our great jefferson:
    nor king nor statesman sealed a nobler pact!
  and worthy the _deed_ of this fair festival,
    when the young land whose life had scarce begun,
  with lofty courage doubt could ne'er appall,
    in the one act a finer victory won
    than war in all her scarlet glory e'er hath done!

                      iii

  an hundred years have passed--what wonders wrought
    along the mississippi's mighty stream!
  the changes time's transforming wand hath brought
    seem but the unreal visions of a dream!
  where stretched in vast expanse to western sea
    the pathless forest and the trackless plain,
  great states and teeming millions soon should be,
    and orchards fair and fields of waving grain
    and every art of peace through that broad land should reign.

                      iv

  hail to the statesman whose far-seeing eyes
    saw in the germ the nation that should be,
  saw how a mighty empire should arise
    and span the continent from sea to sea,
  and building for the future, led the way
    with prescience and high courage, daring fate,
  an emperor's domain in a single day
    bought for a purse of gold! a vast estate,
    from europe's despot gained--to freedom consecrate!

                      v

  conquest of peace! on thy triumphal day
    no mourning captives, chained to victor's car,
  nor spoil of war, nor bloodshed marked thy way,
    nor hate, nor wrong did thy escutcheon mar!
  no throng of armed hosts thy mountains crossed.
    thy forests echoed to no battle cry,
  no glory gained with nation's honor lost,
    nor victor's plaudit, echoed with a sigh.
    louisiana won--nor any doomed to die!

                     vi

  conquest of peace! no alsace here doth kneel,
    and lorraine, scarred with unforgotten scar;
  no riven poland, 'neath the warrior's heel,
    spoil of the victor from the field of war.
  the sun that shines thy boundless plains along
    lights not the smallest hamlet but is free;
  the winds that sweep thy mountains bear no song
    save that the patriot sings--where liberty
    and peace and law now are, and evermore shall be!

                    vii

  so be it ever, through the coming age
    our nation's destiny shall be fulfilled,
  not by the tears that greed or passion wage,
    not by the blood of foes or brethren spilled!
  but in the wiser and the nobler way
    the patriot statesman taught us, when of yore
  his victory of peace in one brief day
    won glory greater than a year of war!
    so may it be, dear land, with thee for evermore!


at the conclusion of the exercises the benediction was pronounced by the
reverend doctor wintner, of brooklyn, new york, in the following words:

"may the lord our god, creator of the universe and father of mankind,
bless all those in our home city afar off, and also those near here, and
may he look down upon you in his kindness and grace, and grant you peace
forevermore. amen."


the luncheon

immediately after the formal exercises, the delegation were guests of

        "'tis the sunset of life gives us mystical lore."

  "brooklyn of the future"
        dr. henry sanger snow
        "there is a fascination in recollections of the past and
        hopes for the future."

the evening reception

the new york city building on the model street, in which the evening

word "brooklyn" appearing in fairy lamps over the main doorway. within a
wealth of palms and smilax was used.

the reception took place between eight and ten and was attended by the
brooklyn delegation, exposition officials, state and national
representatives and many invited guests. an orchestra furnished music
and throughout the evening a buffet luncheon was served. the receiving
line consisted of thomas w. hynes, commissioner for new york city, and
mrs. hynes; vice-president berri, of the state commission, and mrs.
berri; colonel william hester; mr. and mrs. j. edward swanstrom; mr. and

which had journeyed all the way from home to spend four short days at
the fair felt more than repaid for the journey.

thanksgiving day

[illustration]


the fact that the exposition did not close until december first
compelled all employees to remain in st. louis thanksgiving day; that
day which, of all others, generally marks a family gathering. the
commission thoughtfully extended an invitation to all of its employees
and their families in st. louis to be their guests at thanksgiving
dinner in the state building. the number included about sixty-five
people, every attache who was in town accepting the invitation.

the official colony of the empire state at the great exposition
assembled at the state building at one o'clock. all were cordially
greeted by vice-president berri, mrs. berri and mrs. norman e. mack.
before sitting down to dinner a group picture was taken on the front
steps of the building, a copy of which was subsequently presented by the
commission to each employee.

the table was set in the grand hall and was heavily laden with products
of the state of new york. owing to the approaching close of the
exposition, the agricultural and horticultural exhibits were heavily
drawn upon. great heaps of new york's superlative fruit and prize
vegetables were used in decorating the table. messrs. bayno & pindat
served a tempting menu, features of which were those dishes always
associated with thanksgiving day--roast turkey and pumpkin pie. a spirit
of hearty good fellowship pervaded the entire occasion, and each one
vied with his neighbor in adding to the total of the entertainment.

remarks were made between the courses, and early in the event
vice-president berri, who presided, arose and, after complimenting every
one present on behalf of the commission for the part they had taken in
contributing to new york's success at the fair, proceeded in a most
happy vein and said in part, as follows:


remarks by mr. berri

"we should be thankful way down deep in our hearts that we are citizens
of such a great country--the united states of america. when you think of
its wonderful struggle for years and know that to-day it is at the
forefront of progress among the nations of the earth should we not be
thankful that we are a part of it? we should be thankful that we have
such a great president--a man respected by all nations. republicans
should be thankful that they won such a great victory at the polls, and
democrats should be thankful that the republicans give them such good
government.

"the married men here should be thankful that they have such good wives,
and the wives that they have such good husbands; the unmarried men that
they have in the future such a vista of happiness that is to come to
them, and the young ladies should be thankful that there are so many
young men around. there is no way to view this occasion but with a
thanksgiving spirit, and nothing pleases me more than to be with you
to-day. there has been no feature of our fair at any time, in all of its
various functions we have had, that gives me such great pleasure as to
preside at this gathering. it is the first time we have been all brought
together, and, while the hours of the fair are numbered, i am sure that
every one will go home never forgetting the pleasant days they have had
at the great exposition at st. louis in the year nineteen hundred and
four."

he then called upon mrs. norman e. mack, the only other member of the
commission present. mrs. mack was warmly applauded and said:


response by mrs. mack

"it gives me great pleasure to be able to take my thanksgiving dinner
to-day with so many who have done so much for the glory of new york at
this exposition. i particularly wish to compliment those of our own
building who have always been so courteous and nice to me, and by so
doing have aided the new york commission in making the new york state
building the social center of the exposition."


other speakers

brief remarks were also made by mr. j. h. durkee, superintendent of
agriculture; mr. delancey m. ellis, director of education and social
economy; mr. james t. patterson, assistant superintendent of
horticulture; mr. a. b. strough, in charge of the forestry, fish and
game exhibit; dr. h. h. hinshaw, in charge of the scientific exhibit,
and the following officials of the state building: hon. frank j.
lefevre, superintendent; mrs. dore lyon, hostess; mrs. f. p. applebee,
assistant hostess; miss laura c. macmartin, matron, and mr. george b.
cowper, assistant superintendent. others present were called upon and
made appropriate remarks, and the pikers' club, an organization composed
of attaches of the building, furnished the musical part of the
entertainment.


presentation to secretary ball

vice-president berri then presented mr. charles a. ball, secretary and
chief executive officer of the commission, with a complete fishing
outfit in behalf of all of the employees of the new york state
commission. mr. ball enjoys a wide reputation as an expert with the rod.
in his remarks mr. berri said that it had never been demonstrated that
the secretary had ever returned with any fish, and expressed the hope
that with such a perfect equipment some tangible results might be shown.
he also humorously referred to the fact that in the fire which a short
time before had threatened the destruction of the state building, mr.
ball's first thought had been for the safety of his fishing reels. the
presentation was a complete surprise to the secretary, who feelingly
expressed his deep appreciation of the thoughtfulness of his staff in
making him a present which he should treasure as long as he lived. he
also expressed his gratitude to all of the employees of the commission
for their loyal support, which had meant so much in the successful
participation of new york at the greatest fair the world ever knew. he
closed with laudatory remarks concerning the commission, and the wisdom
and thoroughness which had characterized its work.

in the course of her remarks mrs. lyon read the following original poem:


poem by mrs. lyon

  like ships upon the changing sea of life,
    unknowing and unknown until we met,
  we've sailed awhile together, and no strife
    has marred our joy, nor brought a faint regret.

  o'er this composite family of ours,
    begotten from each corner of our state,
  has breathed a peaceful spirit, and the hours
    have sped on wings from early dawn till late.

  'tis something to have met each other here,
    and found in each some trait to be admired,
  and felt the world replete with joy and cheer,
    and friendship still the thing to be desired.

  the tiny corners that we once possessed
    by gentle contact have been rubbed away,
  and words that might have hurt have been suppressed,
    and peacefully we hail this festive day.

  the time when we must part comes on apace,
    and soon we'll wend along our various ways,
  then mem'ry's realm will crowded be for space
    to welcome friends of exposition days.

  to name each one and strive to pay the debt
    we owe, of deepest gratitude and praise
  in words, would take me many hours yet,
    and possibly run over into days.

  and--after all, when all is said and done,
    it only means we've met--to live--to part.
  then here's my wish--that we have just begun
    a friendship which may blossom in each heart.


lantern slides

at the conclusion of the remarks a series of lantern slides illustrating
some of the most attractive natural features of the empire state were
shown, the slides being a part of the exhibit in education. the
entertainment concluded with informal dancing, music for the same being
furnished by an orchestra which was in attendance. the assemblage
dispersed with three rousing cheers for the empire state and for the
louisiana purchase exposition commission of the state of new york.

director of education and social economy

[illustration]



the movement for an educational exhibit of the state of new york at st.
louis was inaugurated at a meeting of the state teachers' association,
held at saratoga in july, 1902, at which a resolution was offered
inviting the various educational associations of the state to co-operate
with the above association in promoting an exhibit commensurate with the
state's educational importance. an immediate response was forthcoming.


the conference committee

ten powerful educational associations and the two state administrative
departments (since merged into the department of education) each sent a
delegate to a central committee, which took the name of "conference
committee," and consisted of chairman, myron t. scudder, principal state
normal school, new paltz, representing the normal principals' council;
secretary, henry l. taylor, representing the university of the state of
new york; a. m. wright, second deputy superintendent of public
instruction, representing the department of public instruction; f. d.
boynton, superintendent of schools, ithaca, representing the state
teachers' association; andrew w. edson, associate superintendent of
schools, city of new york, representing the council of school
superintendents; calvin w. edwards, president board of education,
albany, representing the association of school boards; f. s. fosdick,
principal masten park high school, buffalo, representing the associated
academic principals; george h. walden, principal grammar school no. 10,
rochester, representing the council of grammar school principals; h. j.
schmitz, acting principal state normal school, geneseo, representing the
science teachers' association; a. c. hill, department of public
instruction, representing the training teachers' conference; erwin b.
whitney, school commissioner, first district, broome county,
representing the school commissioners and superintendents' association.

this committee organized as above in october, 1902, and appointed a
subcommittee to appear before the louisiana purchase exposition
commission and request an adequate appropriation and the appointment of
a director to carry on the work.


appointment of director

at the meeting of the commission held june 10, 1903, delancey m. ellis,
of rochester, was appointed director, and the sum of $20,000 was set
aside for the preparation of the educational exhibit. offices were
immediately opened at 46 elwood building, rochester, n. y., and the work
of collecting and preparing the exhibit material was begun. as the
schools were just about to close for the summer holidays but little
could be accomplished, and none of the work of the school year 1902-1903
could be procured. it is to be regretted that time was not allowed to
procure an exhibit of work covering an entire school year. that which
covers a shorter period is of necessity fragmentary and hardly conveys
clearly an idea of the quality or scope of the work being done in a
given institution.


advisory committee

the conference committee was invited to retain its organization and to
take the name of "advisory committee," to co-operate with and assist the
director, the members of the committee to serve without compensation,
but necessary expenses while in discharge of their duties to be paid
from the appropriation for the exhibit.

it would be hard to overestimate the services performed by this
committee. each member took a hearty interest in the work in hand and
freely gave of his time and advice in carrying the work forward to a
successful conclusion. any lack of interest or enthusiasm on the part of
the members of a given association was quickly dispelled by a personal
appeal to its members from its representative upon the committee. in
this way the interest was most genuine and general throughout the state,
and in no way could the sentiment of educational interests be more
clearly crystallized than in a meeting of this committee, and to them is
due the thanks of the commission, as well as the thanks of the
educational forces of the state of new york for their unselfish efforts
and wise counsel, which in so large a way was responsible for the
success of the educational exhibit.


plans presented before educational associations

the director was invited to present the plans for the exhibit at the
following educational meetings during the year 1903: university
convocation, at albany, in june; state teachers' association, at cliff
haven, in july; school commissioners and superintendents, at watkins, in
september; association of superintendents, which met in conjunction with
the massachusetts association of superintendents, at boston, in october,
and associated academic principals, at syracuse in december. the subject
was cordially received, and a general effort was made throughout the
field of education in the empire state to prepare an exhibit which would
surpass any that had ever been gathered before. by means of circulars,
several of which were sent broadcast throughout the state, full
instructions were given to local authorities as to the preparation of
the work, amount of material desired and the proposed plan of
arrangement. throughout the fall and winter the director visited many
cities of the state, consulted with exhibitors as to the most attractive
way of preparing material, and held himself in readiness to assist all
who experienced any difficulty in the preparation of their exhibits. the
exhibit material was collected, systematically arranged and mounted at
the offices in rochester, the entire expense of its preparation and
transportation being borne by the state, with the exception of the
binding of written work and small incidental expenses, which were borne
by the local school authorities.


location of the exhibit

the space assigned to the state of new york contained approximately
2,300 square feet and was most advantageously located. it was directly
within and facing the main north entrance of the palace of education,
and at the intersection of the main north and south aisle and transverse
aisle "b." for its neighbors were the city of st. louis and the state of
missouri, both of which prepared most meritorious exhibits; and the
state of massachusetts, which is always looked upon as standing in the
front rank in educational progress.

the exposition authorities announced that no unit smaller than the state
in public school exhibits would be recognized, except in the case of
four or five cities which had powerful, strongly centralized school
systems, making them worthy of independent space and proper subjects for
individual study.


exhibit of the city of new york

the city of new york was numbered among these exceptions, and
approximately 1,500 square feet of space was assigned it adjoining the
space assigned to the state of new york. the city government
appropriated $10,000 for its exhibit and bore the entire expense of the
same. associate superintendent andrew w. edson was named as committee in
charge of the exhibit by superintendent william h. maxwell. the city
authorities early expressed a willingness and desire to co-operate with
the state authorities in the preparation of an exhibit and agreed to
follow the same general style of installation and arrangement. due
acknowledgment is hereby made to superintendent maxwell, associate
superintendent edson and to committees in charge of minor details for
the adoption of plans already inaugurated in the preparation of the
state exhibit, and to c. b. j. snyder, superintendent of school
buildings in the city of new york, who prepared the plans for the booth
for both the state and city exhibits at no expense to the state.


the installation

the booth was so planned that from the outside it was apparently a
single inclosure, the state and city exhibits being separated on the
interior by an appropriate screen nine feet high, through which an
entranceway was cut. mr. snyder's plans provided for a scheme of
installation which, while inexpensive, was both artistic and dignified
and admirably adapted for the display of the material to be exhibited.
in fact it was generally conceded that much more effective results had
been obtained than by surrounding states which had expended considerably
more money. the inclosure was massive, the woodwork being an effective
imitation of flemish oak, and the hanging surface a burlap of a neutral
green tint; the facade, sixteen feet in height, being broken every few
feet at fixed intervals by fluted pilasters with ornamental caps. on the
outside a wainscoting extended three feet from the floor, above which
were panels for hanging exhibit material, the whole being capped by an
attractive dentulated cornice. the entranceway, which was thrown across
the corner at the intersection of the aisles, was a massive arch,
surmounted by the coat of arms of the state, tinted in old ivory,
underneath which in gold letters was, "state of new york." the interior
was cut by transverse walls, nine feet high and extending seven feet
from the main wall, thus forming a series of alcoves convenient for
study on the part of visitors and leaving in the center an open space
for the display of models, apparatus and cabinet material. directly
facing the entranceway were general and private offices. completely
surrounding the interior of the booth, on the eye line, were 100 wall
cabinets which have come to be so generally used for the display of
exhibit material. the wall space above the cabinets was used for the
display of especially meritorious and attractive material, while below
was a countershelf upon which, here and there, rested a showcase for the
display of sewing, clay modeling, botanical specimens, etc. underneath
the counters were shelves for bound books and cupboards for the storage
of printed matter and supplies. all work was mounted uniformly upon a
scotch gray cardboard and neatly lettered in white ink.


scope of the exhibit

instead of confining the exhibit to the work of the public schools, as
was quite generally done by other states exhibiting, it was decided to
show, so far as possible, work now being done in all forms and phases of
education in the empire state. space was freely given to private
institutions to demonstrate the place which they are filling in the
educational work of the state. every subdivision of the official
classification found an exemplification within the new york state
exhibit. the participation of twenty-four cities and numerous
incorporated villages, both in elementary and high school work, made the
exhibits of those departments thoroughly representative of the work of
the state as a whole. it is unfair to pick the work of a few progressive
school systems, and endeavor to make it stand for the work of the state
at large.


plan of arrangement

the plan of arrangement was arrived at only after the most careful
thought and discussion, the desire being to so arrange the material as
to be most serviceable to the educator and to those seeking suggestions
and helpful ideas. in arranging an educational exhibit, emphasis must be
placed either upon political divisions, subjects or grades. it was early
determined that no separate space should be assigned to any single
locality, but that all of the work of the state in the grades should be
exhibited grade by grade and that of the high schools by subjects, and
arranged under various departments, such as science, classics,
mathematics, etc., thus making it possible for a grade teacher to
readily compare her work with that of new york's, and to profit by the
comparison, no matter in whose favor it might be, and a high school
instructor in charge of a department to readily find the work of that
department. this method rendered it unnecessary to look over the
exhibits from several cities to find the particular work desired.
moreover, a further subdivision was made, in that the work was arranged
according to the population of the contributing cities and villages.
that is, the work from the city of the largest population contributing
was installed first, and so on in order. while it was not the purpose to
invite comparison of work between rival cities of the state, but rather
to present a united front to the world at large, still if it was the
desire of some to make such comparison, the above indicated arrangement
was the most equitable, as all cities of approximately the same
resources and theoretically working under like conditions were placed
side by side, and the work of the small village was not placed in
juxtaposition with that of the large, strongly centralized city system
with many times its resources. a complete catalogue of the exhibit was
freely distributed, and cross-references made to work of the various
localities, so there was no difficulty for those interested in a single
place to locate the work it contributed.

it was generally conceded that, while the above arrangement made no
concession to local pride, it was by all odds the wisest arrangement to
follow in an exposition of international scope. the compliments which
were bestowed upon the arrangement of the exhibit, and the readiness
with which all visitors found the work in which they were particularly
interested, demonstrated beyond a doubt the wisdom of the committee in
pursuing the course above outlined. the entire exhibit was also
carefully classified in harmony with the official classification of the
exposition under the several groups and subdivisions thereof, thereby
rendering additional aid in promptly locating exhibits in any particular
department.


exhibit divisions

entering the booth one found to the left of the entrance the exhibit of
the former state department of public instruction. (it should be stated
here that the exhibits of the university of the state of new york and of
the state department of public instruction were prepared before
unification was an accomplished fact. the two exhibits can be said to
have formed the exhibit of the new department of education.)

next was the exhibit of the kindergartens, filling three units. (the
term "unit" is used to designate one of the wall cabinets containing
thirty-three cards 22 x 28 inches.)

adjoining the kindergarten section was the exhibit of the elementary
grades, filling twenty-five units. all the subjects of the curriculum
were shown, the work in the wall cabinets being "types" or "samples" of
work, the great bulk of which was shown in bound volumes.
cross-reference was made on the margin of each card to the volume
containing similar work, thus facilitating the search of the visitor for
a number of class exercises of work of the same general nature, and
relieving the visitor interested in a general way of looking over a vast
repetition of material. separating the elementary grades from the high
schools was the exhibit of the rural schools of the state, those schools
under the jurisdiction of the several school commissioners. it was most
complete and interesting, and afforded a clear picture of the work done
in the ungraded country schools. the exhibit of the high schools,
filling fourteen units, was next in order, and, as stated above, was
subdivided into subjects. twenty-four cities of the state, to say
nothing of the incorporated villages, private institutions, etc.,
contributed material in one or more of the foregoing departments.

next was installed the exhibit covering the professional training of
teachers, equally divided between the state normal school system and the
work of the training schools and classes in cities and villages, each
occupying five units. every normal school of the state was represented,
each making a special exhibit in the particular subject or subjects
assigned it by a committee of normal school principals, to whom was
delegated the duty of preparing an exhibit. all of the city training
schools in the state, save four, were represented, as well as the great
majority of training classes, the whole exhibit having been arranged by
the state supervisor of training schools and classes.

in the next section was installed the exhibit in higher education,
exhibits being in place from colgate university, hobart college,
manhattan college, the college of pharmacy--allied with columbia
university--and syracuse university, the latter institution making an
exhibit both in applied sciences and in fine arts. next were installed
the exhibits of technical and trade schools, which contained interesting
displays from the leading institutions in the state engaged in this line
of work. just beyond was the exhibit of the industrial schools, and then
the display of special work in education which is being done by
institutions not wholly educational in character. a unique unit was that
devoted to the work of the indian schools of the state, each of the
several reservations being represented, and the whole exhibit being
arranged by the state inspector of indian schools.

the next alcove was devoted to the education of defectives. it contained
concise exhibits from the institutions of the state devoted to the
instruction of the deaf, dumb and blind, and was carefully studied by
those engaged in this work.

the exhibit of summer schools and extension courses adjoined this and
was designed to show the work which is best exemplified by the
chautauqua institution. in a manner allied with this work is that of the
education department in visual instruction, which is carried on by
lantern slides to aid in the teaching of geography, history and kindred
subjects. it was, therefore, installed under this head. the exhibit
received hearty commendation from educators generally, but particularly
from foreign visitors. the scheme is thoroughly practicable, and nowhere
else is it carried on with the same careful attention to detail, nor is
the same perfection of slide making reached as in the state of new york.

the last exhibit before leaving the booth was that of the university of
the state of new york.


special features

there were many features of special interest. a series of thirty-two
charts were prepared as the special exhibit of the new york state
teachers' association, and will be reproduced in the forthcoming report
of that body. to one interested in following the tremendous progress
made in every branch of educational activity within our state during the
past decade, these charts are invaluable. the two charts here reproduced
and which formed a part of the exhibit of the department of public
instruction were the subject of much comment.

the model of the new state normal and training school at fredonia, which
was prepared by the manual training and art classes of the institution,
came in for its share of attention. it was an accurate model of one of
the state's finest educational structures.

the state normal school at new paltz sent a doll house made by the
seventh grade boys for the first grade children in the practice
department, the entire structure being completely furnished and
appointed by the children.

a special feature was the exhibit of clay modeling from the state school
of clay working and ceramics at alfred, the only school of its kind in
the united states receiving state aid. near by stood a cabinet full of
home-made apparatus sent from various institutions, but a large part of
which came from the physical laboratories of pratt institute, brooklyn.
the exhibit contained much of interest to a science teacher.

on the exterior of the facade was a huge educational map of the state,
upon which was shown the location, grade, construction and normal
capacity of every institution of learning within its borders. the
superiority of new york's schoolhouses was shown by the large number
constructed of brick and stone. the year 1904 marked the passing of the
log schoolhouse, only four of which were shown upon the map as against
approximately fifty ten years ago. the facade also contained an
admirable exhibit of art work prepared by the students of the new york
school of applied design for women.


significance of some city exhibits

various methods of instruction peculiar to certain cities or localities
were fully set forth. albany exhibited the work of one of the most
complete systems of free kindergartens in the country, as well as the
correlation of subjects in the elementary grades; also manual training
and art courses in the high school. batavia demonstrated the system of
individual instruction as carried on in its schools, which involves the
employment of two teachers in each classroom. syracuse exemplified its
courses in art, manual training and physical training in the elementary
grades. jamestown clearly set forth its course in manual training
throughout the entire school course, while ithaca, in addition to a
well-rounded exhibit, by means of photographs, brought out the subject
of high school athletics. the exhibit from yonkers, which was general in
character, portrayed the efficiency and superiority of the school
equipment in that city.


editorial comment

the exhibit from first to last demonstrated beyond peradventure the
beneficial results accruing from a strongly centralized, and, at the
same time, most liberal administration of educational interests.

a prominent morning daily paper, commenting editorially upon the
exhibit, says: "it is worth your attention; it means more to every
citizen of the empire state than any other exhibit shown. the chief
product of the empire state is men; neither fields of grain or
manufactures, invention or art are as important a product as men. in new
york state are produced some of the greatest men of the country. a large
part of the raw material comes into new york harbor past 'liberty
enlightening the world,' and is gradually converted into citizenship.
... some of the raw material imported is next to worthless; some of the
domestic stuff is equally unpromising, but in the great bulk, year in
and year out, there is the making of fine men. ... new york state men
are scattered throughout the country. they found the cities of the west;
they run the railroads; they manipulate the finances; they capitalize
the new enterprises; they invest in the futures; they get into the
public offices; they plan the political campaigns; they produce the new
ideas; they center current history. men are made in new york state in
the schools. ... the better the schools the finer the quality of the men
produced. therefore, the school exhibit of new york state should
interest every citizen, as the schools have been bettering year by year
and the product increasing in value. ... the commission in charge of
this exhibit has spared no expense to make this educational showing a
storehouse of novel ideas and suggestions dealing with the advance in
pedagogy, and of the state's resources in the teaching of the young
idea."


disposition of material

many requests were received from the representatives of foreign
governments, agents of pedagogical museums and individuals for portions
of the exhibit, but the determination of the lewis and clark exposition
commission of the state of new york to send the entire exhibit to the
exposition at portland, oregon, precluded the possibility of acceding to
these requests and insures the holding intact of the entire exhibit
throughout the portland exposition period, at the conclusion of which it
is to be hoped that provision will be made for the establishment of a
pedagogical museum at the capitol in albany, of which this exhibit may
be made the nucleus.

the staff

the director acknowledges the loyalty and efficiency of those associated
with him in the work of the department. to them belongs a large share of
any credit which may be forthcoming for the value of the exhibit.

in an educational exhibit, probably more than any other, the necessity
of a personal explanation to supplement the work exhibited is necessary.
miss olive c. kellogg, of new york city, and miss clara m. paquet, of
cohoes, expert attendants, were always ready to explain the work
exhibited, and to give full information concerning the distinctive
features of the various city systems and institutions. they spoke the
principal foreign languages, thus aiding visitors from abroad in more
easily grasping the ideas set forth and the methods exemplified.

miss mary macarthur, of rochester, n.y., served throughout the period of
preparation and through the exposition period as general assistant and
stenographer; hugh j. kelly, of albany, n.y., as assistant and clerk,
and e.j. haddleton and h.b. skinner, of albany, as expert letterers and
draftsmen.

fine arts exhibit and schedule of awards


the fine arts exhibit

by charles m. kurtz

acting secretary of the executive committee on art

[illustration]


up to the time of the organization of the committee on art for the state
of new york, appointed by the new york state louisiana purchase
exposition commission, very little had been accomplished in the
direction of securing a collection of representative works by the
artists of new york for exhibition at the world's fair at st. louis.
professor ives, chief of the department of art of the louisiana purchase
exposition, and assistant chief kurtz had visited new york at frequent
intervals (the first time in january, 1902), had aroused considerable
interest in the exposition among the artists, and had secured the
appointment of advisory committees of painters, sculptors, architects,
mural painters, miniature painters, engravers, wood engravers,
illustrators and workers in the applied arts to look after the
organization of exhibits in their respective fields of expression and
the interests of the department of art of the louisiana purchase
exposition in connection therewith.


ways and means

it was impossible, however, for the work to be carried on in an adequate
and worthy manner without state co-operation and assistance, and a
committee of artists, representing the various advisory committees,
appeared before the commission, asked that a committee of artists
representing the state of new york be appointed to co-operate with the
advisory committees in the organization of a creditable art exhibit, and
that a suitable sum of money be appropriated from the funds placed at
the disposal of the commission to defray the cost of organizing the
exhibit, packing, transporting it to and from st. louis, and insuring it
while in transit; the exposition authorities having agreed to pay the
cost of unpacking in st. louis, installation, insurance while in the art
palace, and repacking and forwarding at the close of the exposition.


executive committee on art

after several meetings at the offices of the commission in new york city
and a forceful presentation of the condition of affairs (and the urgent
necessity of action by the commission) by mr. watrous, of the artists'
committee, the commission formally resolved to appropriate the sum of
$10,000 for the purpose indicated, and appointed the following
"executive committee on art for the state of new york" to assume general
direction of the work within the limits of the appropriation: herbert
adams (sculptor), grosvenor atterbury (architect), j. carroll beckwith
(painter), francis c. jones (painter), louis loeb (painter and
illustrator), will h. low (painter, illustrator and mural painter) and
harry w. watrous (painter). these men variously represented membership
in the national academy of design, the society of american artists, the
national sculpture society, the society of mural painters, the american
water color society, the society of illustrators, the new york etching
club, the american fine art society, the american institute of
architects, the new york architectural league, the municipal art society
of new york and the fine arts federation of new york. the committee
formally organized by the election of harry w. watrous as chairman.
charles m. kurtz, assistant chief of the department of art of the
louisiana purchase exposition, was appointed acting secretary without
salary.

at a general meeting of the members of all the advisory committees in
new york city, called by chairman watrous at the national academy of
design, for each committee representing a group of the classification a
chairman and a secretary was elected and general plans were formulated
for the carrying on of the work.

thereafter, frequent meetings were held by the various committees, at
nearly all of which the chairman of the executive committee and the
acting secretary were present and participated in the work.


careful selection of material

the juries of selection for the different groups of the classification
of the department of art, constituted from the membership of the
advisory committees representing various sections of the country, met
and acted during the last two weeks of march, 1904, in the city of new
york, passing upon upwards of 4,000 works submitted for exhibition. of
this assemblage of works a comparatively small number represented
artists of high reputation, and a small proportion was found to be of
sufficient merit worthily to represent the artists of the state. the
number of exhibits secured thus being very small, and many of the more
prominent artists not having submitted works, the different group juries
held meetings, prepared lists of representative works calculated to
reflect credit upon the state, and specifically invited artists and
owners to lend the same for the exposition. by this means the larger and
better portion of the exhibit was secured.

the state of new york, the louisiana purchase exposition and the artists
in general in the state of new york are under great obligations to the
members of these juries who so freely, unselfishly and devotedly gave
their valuable time and effort to the organization of the art exhibit
which represented so comprehensively the best achievement of new york
artists.


a representative exhibit

almost every new york painter of individuality and ability--in oil,
water-color and miniature work--was represented adequately and
creditably; the exhibit of sculpture was exceptionally fine; etching and
engraving were exemplified by the ablest exponents of these branches of
art, wood engraving by types of its highest expression; there was an
excellent collection of works from the leading american illustrators,
and noteworthy examples of the applied arts--of artistic handicrafts--by
new york art workers were well in evidence. in architecture, while the
exhibit was creditable, it might have been more comprehensive and
representative; and the same might be said of the exhibit of mural
painting. the latter, however, as readily may be understood, is
extremely difficult of representation at an exposition--most of its
examples having been executed in place, and only cartoons or photographs
of achieved works usually being available for exhibition.

agriculture and live stock exhibit and schedule of awards


agriculture and live stock exhibit

by j. h. durkee

superintendent

[illustration]



the new york state commission, in july, 1903, appointed j. h. durkee, of
sandy hill, n. y., superintendent of agriculture, live stock and dairy
products, with john mccann, of elmira, howard moon, of cobleskill,
theodore horton, of elmira, and w. a. smith as assistants in the
department of agriculture, w. w. smallwood, of warsaw, and w. a.
mccoduck, of sandy hill, having direct supervision of live stock and
dairy products respectively. george a. smith, of geneva, was
superintendent for collecting dairy products. these gentlemen did the
work assigned them faithfully and well, which is fully attested by the
number of grand prizes and medals won in these departments.


scope of exhibit

new york state has no distinctive agricultural product as has many of
the other, especially some of the western, states but grows nearly
everything in larger or smaller quantities that is grown in the north
temperate zone.

in collecting and installing this exhibit, the aim was to gather these
varied products and arrange them so as to show the real grain or
vegetable to the best advantage rather than to show a fancifully
arranged display of such products as would be of little or no value to
those interested in practical agriculture. with this end in view, each
section of the state was drawn upon for the best samples of the staple
crops of that section. these samples were carefully inspected by
competent judges, and only those of real merit were placed in the
collection for exhibit. so thoroughly was this work of selection done
that a large proportion of the samples received an award.


labeling each specimen

that the exhibit might be of the greatest value to those most interested
in agricultural pursuits, on each sample was placed a card giving the
name and variety of the sample, also the name and post office address of
the grower. every day men could be seen with pencil and paper in hand
taking names and addresses for future correspondence.


continuous display of vegetables

new york was one of the few states that had its exhibit complete at the
opening of the exposition, and was the only state that made a large and
continuous display of fresh vegetables. its display was greatly admired
and favorably commented upon by the press, as well as by individuals.
from the opening of the exposition until the crop of 1904 was ready, the
tables of the new york exhibit were kept filled with the standard
vegetables of 1903, which had been placed in cold storage and were
brought out as needed.

at the close of the exposition, december 1, 1904, new york had over
forty varieties of potatoes as well as many other vegetables on
exhibition that were gathered in 1903, having been out of the ground
over fifteen months. to the inexperienced eye, they could not be
distinguished from the crop of 1904. in october and november, new york's
vegetable display was unusually fine. the judges who passed upon it said
it was the finest collection of vegetables they had ever seen.


awards

the catalogue of exhibitors which follows shows conclusively that new
york is truly the empire state so far as agricultural products are
concerned. it was the only state that was awarded a grand prize on fresh
vegetables alone. j. m. thorburn & co., of new york, glendale stock
farm, glens falls, and cornell university, ithaca, also received grand
prizes on vegetables.

horticulture exhibit and schedule of awards


horticulture exhibit

by charles h. vick

superintendent of horticulture

[illustration]


at a meeting of the louisiana purchase exposition commission of the
state of new york, held june 10, 1903, charles h. vick, of rochester,
n.y., was appointed as superintendent of horticulture, and an
appropriation of $15,000 was made for the exhibit in that department.
this amount was subsequently increased to $20,000. the work was
inaugurated july first, and offices were opened at 46 elwood building,
rochester, n.y.


methods of soliciting fruit

many hundred letters were mailed to the fruit growers of the state
soliciting the donation of fruit for an exhibit at st. louis. the number
of replies received was so small that it was necessary again to
circularize the growers offering to pay a reasonable price for
exhibition fruit. even this offer did not bring forth anything like a
sufficient quantity of fruit to make a suitable exhibit. the state was
then divided into six sections and competent men appointed to canvass
thoroughly each section and buy fruit. a large collection of fine
specimens of fruit were procured by this method, and as a result of this
canvass exhibits were procured from every fruit growing county in the
state. this fruit was all collected at the gleason cold storage
warehouse at brighton, near rochester, n.y., and on december 1, 1903, a
shipment of two cars, containing four hundred barrels of apples,
fifty-five bushel boxes of pears and forty baskets of grapes were
forwarded to the mound city cold storage warehouse at st. louis.


location of exhibit

the exhibit was housed in the palace of horticulture, which, although
located in a somewhat remote part of the grounds, received its full
share of exposition visitors, all of whom were deeply interested in the
magnificent displays of fruit found there.

the state of new york was assigned 4,000 square feet of space
advantageously located near the northeast corner of the building. to the
west were the exhibits of illinois and missouri, and to the east those
of minnesota and washington, while colorado bounded new york on the
south and pennsylvania on the north. in august, new york was assigned
the space surrendered by pennsylvania, approximately 1,200 square feet,
to accommodate the large exhibit of grapes from the central new york
growers and from the chautauqua grape and wine association.


the installation

the space included three distinct sections, nos. 40, 41 and 43,
completely surrounded by aisles, thus affording an excellent opportunity
of viewing the exhibit from all sides. on account of this an open
installation was erected. around section 43 was thrown an open facade,
consisting of columns supporting a handsome cornice, which bore the coat
of arms of the state and the words "the state of new york" on each side.
on the cornice rested fifteen fine specimens of boston ferns.

the fruit was displayed upon tables of varying lengths and from three to
four feet in width. in the center of this space was the office of the
superintendent. sections 40 and 41 were within the zone in which low
installation was required by the exposition authorities, so that no
facade was erected in these sections, the name of the state being shown
upon handsome ornamental gilt signs, placed upon the tables and
suspended over the exhibit. the entire installation was of white enamel,
kept spotlessly clean. the plates used were of special design. the
center was white, with the monogram in green letters, "l. p. e., 1904,"
and a wide green border, with a gold band. the white and green furnished
a most appropriate background for the varicolored fruit and the effect
was most pleasing as the eye swept over the whole exhibit.


a word of commendation

on the opening day of the fair, april thirtieth, new york's exhibit of
fruit was complete in every detail. in fact of the thirty-five states,
canada and mexico represented, new york was the only state to have its
exhibit installed and ready for exhibition when the doors of the palace
of horticulture were thrown open to the public, which called forth a
special word of commendation from the chief of the department of
horticulture, honorable f. w. taylor. owing to the fact that at that
time the other states were not prepared to make a display, it was deemed
inadvisable to exhibit a large number of varieties, so that while the
entire space was covered with fruit, the exhibit consisted of but
thirty-one varieties of apples, ten of pears and three of grapes, as
follows:

apples: fallawater, swarr, golden russet, snow,
  belleflower, sweet russet, cline's red, red rock, holland
  pippin, hubbardston nonesuch, deacon jones,
  judson, sklanka bog, peach, sutton beauty, flower of
  genesee, baldwin, lady, kirkland pippin, greening,
  spitzenburg, northern spy, walbridge, seek-no-further,
  mcintosh, grimes' golden, wagener, mann, roxbury,
  russet, king, canada red
pears: kieffer, duchess, vergalieu, josephine, diel,
  beurre d'anjou, beurre bosc, lawrence, mt. vernon,
  beurre clairgeau
grapes: virgennes, diana, catawba


a high standard of excellence

from the opening to the close of the fair, december first, new york's
exhibit of fruit was maintained at a uniformly high standard of
excellence. the total number of varieties of fruit exhibited was as
follows:

apples ......... 424 varieties
cherries .......  31 "
currants .......   4 "
gooseberries ...   1 "
grapes ......... 150 "
pears .......... 152 "
plums .......... 129 "
quinces ........   8 "
peaches ........  14 "
strawberries ...   1 "

the empire state far outstripped her sister states as to number of
varieties of fruit, displaying twice as many varieties of apples, pears
and plums, and more than three times as many varieties of grapes as her
nearest competitor, and this be it said, in a display of fruits never
before equaled either in size, variety or quality.


record of entries

over 2,000 individual entries of fruit were made during the season, and
as all of the fruit was entered twice, once for the general collection
of the state and again for the grower, the total number of entries was
nearly five thousand. an accurate record was kept of all entries, the
following information being carefully tabulated:
the name and address of the exhibitor.
date of removal from cold storage.
date placed upon the table.
date of removal from the table.
remarks concerning its condition.


fruit of 1904

the new fruit of the fall of 1904, while free from rust and of good
color, was somewhat smaller in size than the fruit of 1903; nevertheless
it made a grand display, and from the opening to the close of the fair
from 2,000 to 2,500 plates of fruit, including never less than 150
varieties of apples, were admired by the thousands of visitors.


apples

the apples placed in cold storage at st. louis in december of 1903 were
found to be in almost perfect condition when opened in april, and, with
a few exceptions, continued so throughout the season. most of the apples
were wrapped first in tissue and then in oiled paper and firmly packed
in barrels well lined with corrugated paper, with excelsior cushions in
each end.

owing to the fact that so much depends upon the condition of fruit when
picked, and the necessity of placing it in cold storage as soon as
picked, it was a difficult matter to make a comparative test of the
keeping qualities of the different varieties. for instance, of two
different collections of baldwins (one of the best keepers), placed on
the tables at the same time, one lot held up in perfect condition for
several weeks while the other went down in as many days.

the varieties showing the best keeping qualities were baldwin,
spitzenberg, russet, northern spy and canada red. these varieties were
kept in cold storage and placed on the tables as late in the season as
november fifteenth, when they were found to have retained their color,
firmness and flavor.

some of the fall varieties, which are ordinarily supposed to be poor
keepers, came out of cold storage in perfect condition and kept
remarkably well after being placed on the tables. among these the
alexander, fallawater, holland pippin, mcintosh and rome beauty were the
best.

a collection of fallawaters from w.r. fitch, of rushville, n.y., were
placed on the tables april twenty-ninth, when they attracted
considerable attention on account of their unusual size and fine color,
and remained in splendid condition for weeks. while somewhat shriveled
and dried up, they showed no signs of decay when removed from the tables
july twentieth. the same is true of a collection of holland pippins and
mcintoshes placed on exhibition at the same time.

a collection of alexanders from j.b. collamer, of hilton, will serve as
an illustration of the advantages of picking at the proper time,
handling with care and placing in cold storage immediately. these apples
were exhibited for a week at the state fair held at syracuse in
september of 1903. they were then wrapped, packed and sent to st. louis,
where they were kept in cold storage until june twenty-sixth, when they
were placed on exhibition until after the visit of governor odell, june
twenty-ninth. on june thirtieth they were rewrapped and repacked and
sent back to cold storage until a few days before the state fair at
syracuse in september of 1904, when they were shipped to syracuse and
again exhibited for a week. at the close of the state fair they were
again returned to st. louis and exhibited for two weeks.

the newtown pippin is another variety which showed excellent keeping
qualities. on august twelfth a collection of forty-six plates from henry
d. lewis, of annandale, was taken out of cold storage and placed on
exhibition. they held up in good condition until the thirtieth of
august, during the hottest weather of the season.

the greenings, while large in size, of fine color, and apparently in
perfect condition when packed, invariably came out of cold storage badly
scalded and discolored. in fact, there were only three or four lots
which were entirely free from scald.

in september, large additions of new fruit were made to the exhibit from
individual growers, and also from the new york agricultural experiment
station at geneva.

george w. anderson, charles n. baker, samuel j. wells and t.h. king are
among the exhibitors who deserve special mention for the quality and
extent of their exhibits.

a complete list of the 424 varieties of apples exhibited appears
following the list of exhibitors.


grapes

the grape industry of new york had adequate and successful
representation at the st. louis exposition, as a department of the
general horticultural exhibit. this industry in new york is one of large
and steadily increasing importance. the state ranks second only to
california in the production of grapes, and the showing made in the
horticulture building was a revelation to thousands of visitors who
there obtained their first knowledge of the extent of the viticulture
industry in new york.

this sign was conspicuously displayed over the exhibit of grapes:

"new york leads in table grapes

"600,000 acres; 30,000,000 vines; crop worth $2,763,711
annually."

these figures are from census reports, and represent an advance of 198
per cent in the industry over its condition as represented at the
columbian exposition in 1893. there is scarcely another such record of
increase in the whole range of industries of the united states.

no attempt was made to show viticulture in any other way than by its
product, but an almost continuous display of grapes was kept on the
tables from the opening of the exposition to its close. this in itself
was a noteworthy achievement, for it included a display of cold storage
grapes from the crop of 1903 up to the second week of july, 1904,
something never before attempted. a display of forced fruit and early
varieties began shortly after that date.

a collection of hot-house grapes grown by mr. david m. dunning, of
auburn, was an interesting feature of the grape exhibit and amazed
crowds of visitors on account of their size and handsome appearance. the
varieties were barbarossa and muscat hamburg. one cluster of the latter
variety weighed nine pounds and measured seventeen inches in length,
exclusive of stem. this collection of grapes far surpassed anything of
the kind shown in the horticulture building, not even excepting
california specimens.

the varieties in cold storage were as follows: catawba, diana, iona,
isabella, niagara, salem and virgennes. of these varieties, the catawba
and virgennes kept the longest. they were taken from cold storage july
third and placed upon exhibition for a week, at the end of which time
they were found to have retained their color and flavor perfectly. this
was fully one month later than grapes were preserved at the pan-american
exposition, notwithstanding the difference in distance between buffalo
and st. louis from the vineyards. the diana and iona were close seconds
in keeping qualities, while the isabella rattled badly and the niagara
showed discoloration, though both retained fairly good flavor.

the display proper of the 1904 crop began early in september. this
display was entirely made up of fruit contributed by the growers of the
chautauqua and keuka lake districts. these two districts were
represented about in proportion to their acreages and products.

the grapes were well wrapped in paper and packed in a new style paper
grape basket, furnished by mullen bros. paper company, of st. joseph,
michigan. these baskets were packed in spring crates, and the grapes,
with a very few exceptions, carried in perfect condition.

the grape exhibit was made adjacent to the rest of the new york exhibit.
the tables afforded room for about 2,000 plates. the display was made up
largely of concord, catawba, niagara, virgennes, campbell early and
other commercial varieties.

the rarer varieties, however, were not neglected, as will be seen from
the list of one hundred and fifty varieties appearing elsewhere.


pears

in october of 1903, fifty-five bushel boxes of pears were placed in cold
storage to be used for the exposition. of this number, twenty-five boxes
were purchased from david k. bell, of brighton, and the balance came in
single bushels from some of the best growers of the state. the pears,
like the apples, were wrapped first in heavy tissue paper and then in
oiled paper.

the following is a list of the varieties kept in cold storage: beurre
d'anjou, beurre bosc, beurre clairgeau, beurre diel, angouleme,
columbia, duchess, howell, josephine of malines, kieffer, lawrence, mt.
vernon, rutter and vergalieu.

on april twenty-fifth, when the boxes were examined and a selection made
for the opening day, the duchess was found in poorer condition than any
of the other varieties. notwithstanding this fact, a continuous exhibit
of duchess pears was made until may thirtieth. all the other varieties
were in prime condition, and were displayed in lots of fifty plates
until may twenty-sixth, when one grand exhibit was made, consisting of
four hundred plates of fifteen varieties. this display continued in good
condition until the sixteenth of june, in spite of the extreme hot
weather at that time, the anjou, angouleme, bosc, clairgeau, columbia,
howell and kieffer keeping extremely well until that date.

the display in the fall of 1904 attracted a great deal of attention, not
alone from visitors, but also from the superintendents of horticulture
from the other states and from fruit growers in general. on september
nineteenth, one hundred and forty-two varieties were exhibited from
ellwanger & barry, of rochester; on september twenty-first, twenty
varieties were exhibited from david k. bell, of brighton, in addition to
the general display from almost every section of the state, making an
exhibit of pears never before equaled.

a complete list of the one hundred and fifty-two varieties of pears
exhibited will be found following the list of exhibitors.


plums

as the result of a bountiful plum crop, the display of this luscious and
popular fruit was unusually large and fine. the first shipment,
consisting of early red june, was received from f. e. dawley, of
fayetteville, on august fifth, and from that time until september
twenty-sixth, additions were made almost daily. one hundred and
twenty-eight varieties, arrayed on hundreds of plates, and occupying
nearly a third of the new york space, compelled the attention and
admiration of every passer-by. and indeed, it was an attractive sight,
from the stand-point of color alone, comprising, as it did, nearly every
shade of green, yellow, purple, blue, orange and red.

the varieties attracting the most attention were abundance, arch duke,
burbank, coe's golden drop, grand duke, quackenboss and st. lawrence.
the display of burbank was the largest and finest ever shown, the best
two lots coming from fred h. teats, of williamson, and t. h. king, of
trumansburg.

splendid collections were also received from f. e. dawley, of
fayetteville, consisting of eleven varieties; s. d. willard, of geneva,
twenty-three varieties; new york agricultural experiment station, at
geneva, one hundred and five varieties.

a total of one hundred and twenty-eight varieties were exhibited; all of
the varieties are listed following the list of exhibitors.


cherries

thirty-one varieties of cherries were exhibited, the largest exhibit
coming from the new york agricultural experiment station. no other state
excelled in number of varieties.

see the list following the list of exhibitors.


peaches

new york's peach crop was not up to the usual standard, being more or
less infected with rust and lacking in color. it was also found to be a
difficult matter to get shipments to st. louis in good condition.

there were liberal quantities of such varieties as were shown, a list of
which appears following the list of exhibitors.


quinces

the crop of 1904 was unusually small and inferior in quality.
nevertheless a fairly good exhibit was made.

the varieties shown appear following the list of exhibitors.


currants

it was impossible to make a general display of small fruits, owing to
the distance from new york to st. louis. four varieties of currants were
shown, however, the perfection currant, from c. g. hooker, of rochester,
excelling in size, quality and flavor any currant exhibited.

a list of varieties appears following the list of exhibitors.


gooseberries

the gooseberry crop was a total failure in new york, and only one small
exhibit was made of the downing.


strawberries

it was the intention to make a large exhibit of strawberries, and
arrangements were partially made with mr. l. j. farmer, of pulaski, to
collect this exhibit, but owing to the very poor condition of shipments
received from illinois, missouri and other nearby states, the plan was
abandoned, as it was feared that the berries would be spoiled in
transit. one exhibit, however, was made. this was the ryckman strawberry
and came from g. e. ryckman, of brocton. owing to extreme care in
packing, this small exhibit came in fairly good condition, and excited
much comment on account of its size, color, fine flavor and prolific
production.


plants and flowers

the exhibit of plants and flowers was, for the most part, made out of
doors in beds, which were attractively laid out in the grounds
surrounding the horticulture and agriculture buildings. the extent of
the grounds afforded opportunity for the massing of the different
varieties of hardy plants, such as roses, peonies, hydrangeas, and also
of the newer varieties of cannas and geraniums. in the conservatory
adjoining the horticulture building proper were exhibited fine
collections of ferns and a large display of gladiolas, and also one of
peonies.


some gratifying comparisons

the following statistics from the united states census of 1903 may be of
interest:

new york leads in the production of fruit, exclusive of subtropical
fruits. twelve and one-tenth per cent of the fruit production of the
united states is in new york.

orchard fruit of 1903 was valued at            $10,542,272
grapes of 1903 were valued at                    2,763,711
small fruits of 1903 were valued at              2,538,363

the following table will give an idea of the extensive cultivation of
small fruits:
                                      acres product-quarts

raspberries                          12,376     17,575,530
strawberries                          7,311     13,846,860
currants                              2,594      4,584,080
blackberries                          2,060      3,167,090
other berries                           710        862,107

                            number of vines product-pounds

grapes                           29,636,316    247,689,056

from the following a comparison may be drawn between the number of trees
and apple product of the two leading apple states:

                            number of trees product-bushels

new york                         15,054,832     24,111,257
missouri                         20,040,399      6,496,436

the average number of apple trees per farm in the united states was
74.5; the same for new york was 86.2. the average production in bushels
per farm in the united states was 64.8; the same for new york was 138.1.

a considerable proportion of the trees in missouri, quoted above, are
young trees, and the relative products will soon show far different
results unless new york fruit growers awake to the situation. in all of
the western fruit growing states the annual planting of young trees is
rapidly increasing, a precaution which our fruit growers are not taking
to any great extent. moreover, the lack of interest on the part of new
york growers in expositions and the opportunity there afforded for
advertising the superiority of new york products is a subject for
comment. it is in marked contrast to the interest and progressive spirit
of the growers in the western states who never lose such an opportunity,
and are gradually working into the front ranks of fruit production. in
many of the western states no public funds nor machinery were provided
for a horticultural exhibit at st. louis, but very creditable exhibits
were prepared, the entire expense of the same being borne by fruit
growers' associations. in marked contrast is a rather unfortunate
precedent heretofore adopted in the state of new york, and of necessity
followed at st. louis, viz.: that the state, in order to obtain a
creditable exhibit, must pay a fancy price for fruit for exhibition
purposes and allow the seller to receive the award upon fruit which is
no longer his own property.


the staff

in addition to the superintendent the staff connected with the
department consisted of james g. patterson, of sheridan, assistant
superintendent; john w. coughtry, of new scotland, and sherman t. lewis,
of johnsonburg, assistants in charge of fruit exhibit; a. m. loomis, of
fredonia, assistant in charge of viticulture, and miss bessie j.
hutchinson, of rochester, stenographer. one and all they served the
commission and the state faithfully and efficiently.


awards

the state received a total of 295 awards, divided as follows: a grand
prize for installation, a grand prize for the collective state exhibit
of fruit, 19 gold medals, 142 silver medals and 132 bronze medals. owing
to the rules and regulations governing the system of awards, however,
prizes were not so freely distributed as at the world's fair at chicago,
or the pan american exposition at buffalo. heretofore it has always been
the custom to allow the exhibitor a medal for a collection of apples,
another for a collection of pears, another for plums, etc., while at st.
louis only one award was allowed an exhibitor for his entire collective
exhibit. the jury in the department of horticulture was on duty
throughout the exposition period, and as soon as an exhibit was placed
upon the tables it was promptly passed upon by the jury, due application
having been made.

forest, fish and game exhibit and schedule of awards


forest, fish and game exhibit

by a. b. strough

special agent of the forest, fish and game commission, state of new york


the state exhibit in the forest fish and game department was prepared
and installed by the forest, fish and game commission, with funds
furnished by the louisiana purchase exposition commission of the state
of new york.


a sportsman's camp

a modern sportsman's camp of rustic design, fourteen feet by seventeen
feet in size, was constructed and furnished after the general style and
appearance of the usual summer residence in the adirondack mountains.
the contractor for the erection of this camp was the firm of messrs. d.
b. & d. f. sperry, of old forge, n. y. mr. d. f. sperry, "frank," as he
is known to visitors to the adirondacks, had personal charge of the
construction and was something of an exhibit himself. being a lifelong
adirondack guide, and having been employed by many prominent people,
among others, ex-president harrison, any rustic work from his hand was
sure to attract attention.

it was unfortunate that it was impossible to have him, or some other
adirondack guide, in attendance at the "camp" all through the season, as
many visitors wished to see and talk with some such person. some of
them, seeing the sperry name-plate on the end of a log of the camp,
inquired for "frank," expecting to find him in attendance. he has had
many inquiries from people residing at widely separated places in
various parts of the country, for duplicates of the camp exhibit, or for
some other design of rustic building.


construction of the camp

the camp was constructed of adirondack spruce logs and the chimney was
of the same external construction. the roof was covered with spruce
bark. all the material showing inside the camp was, as far as possible,
left in natural condition, the logs with the bark on, and the underside
of the roof boards unplaned, showing the coarse saw marks.

innumerable inquiries were made by interested visitors, particularly
those coming from the southern and western states, as to the species of
timber used in constructing the camp. when informed that the logs were
of spruce much interest was shown. many had never seen spruce before.


the furniture

a part of the furniture was built by mr. sperry, and the remainder by
another adirondack guide, mr. e. e. sumner, of saranac lake, n. y. mr.
sperry made the bedstead, the window settee and the center table, after
a style that is common in the adirondack camps. the woodwork was of
spruce, turned smooth and stained a light smoke color to give it a
finished appearance. mr. sumner constructed the other furniture in the
best rustic style, the framework being of white cedar with the bark on,
and the bottoms of the chairs and settees of white birch bark. both of
these guides have had many inquiries for duplicates of their handiwork
as exhibited. the "atmosphere" of the camp was that of everyday life in
the forest. the bed was "made up" as though the owner was expected to
occupy it at night. garments and articles that had seen service, such as
a leather hunting jacket, a gun case, "pack" baskets, fish reels and
snow shoes were hung on the walls in proper places.


attractive features

the mantel and fireplace particularly attracted attention. the mantel
was of spruce with the bark on, and the fireplace was constructed with a
stone facing and lining, showing andirons and birch logs in place as in
actual use. in one corner there was shelving for bric-a-brac, fishing
tackle, ammunition, etc., constructed by utilizing a discarded fishing
boat, cutting the same across the center into two parts and placing
shelves at convenient intervals, fastening the same on the ribs of the
boat.

in another corner was a swing table that could be hung up against the
wall when not in use. on the mantel were placed articles of rustic work
that harmonized with the surroundings--a rustic clock, wooden pipes and
smoking set to match, a stein and mug of wood, together with other
articles of ornament and utility. a piece of library shelving of unique
design and special construction was provided and furnished with standard
publications on fish, birds and animals, and stories of life in the
forest and of the chase. thirty books were shown, a number of which were
kindly furnished by messrs. doubleday, page & co., of new york city. on
the center table were kept the current numbers of the leading sporting
magazines, both weekly and monthly.


wall decorations

the walls were decorated with bright colored indian blankets, flags and
souvenir paddles, on which were painted various national flags and
camping scenes. the paddles being of a very white spruce and the
background being the spruce logs of the camp with dark colored bark, the
effect was pleasing and attracted much attention.

an interesting and valuable feature of the furnishing and decoration of
the camp, and, incidentally, souvenirs of the chase, were a large fine
moose head over the mantel, an elk's head on the gable outside, bucks'
heads at the sides of the porch in front of the camp, and the furs of
red foxes, deer and black bear. some of the furs were specially prepared
for rugs and placed on the floor of the camp, giving the interior an air
of comfort and cheerfulness.


hunting and fishing outfit

the hunting and fishing outfit consisted of two repeating rifles, one a
savage and the other a winchester, a double-barreled shotgun, three
fishing rods, one each of steel, split lancewood and split bamboo, and a
collection which included trout flies, landing nets, minnow pail, reels,
lines, cartridge belt, loading set and other paraphernalia. a guide-boat
of the latest style and of superior workmanship was a part of the
sportsman's outfit. this boat was kindly loaned by the manufacturer, mr.
fred w. rice, formerly of saranac lake, n. y., but now living at
seattle, wash. his son continues the manufacture of guide-boats at lake
placid, n. y.


balsam pillows

on the settee and bed in the camp were a number of balsam pillows. a
large and particularly fine one came from the higby camp on big moose
lake in the adirondacks. it was made by miss lila daisy higby, a little
lady only seven years of age, whose needlework decorating the cover
showed artistic ability of great merit for one so young. many visitors
admired it, and some of them have written her in complimentary terms.

the odor from these pillows filled the camp, and instantly attracted the
attention of visitors. one of the questions usually asked first of the
attendant was where the perfume came from and what it was. some supposed
it to be from the logs of which the camp was constructed. many visitors
wanted to know where they could obtain such pillows. those purchased for
the camp came from mr. a. m. church, boonville, n. y., who also
furnished the gun rack so much admired, and also the fur rugs.


fire notice

on the side of the camp in a conspicuous place was posted a fire notice
such as may be found in thousands of places along the trail throughout
the adirondacks and catskills. visitors that had been through our
mountains recognized this feature instantly, for these notices may be
found at all the hotels and public places, and also on a great many of
the private camps. this little placard printed on cloth attracted much
attention. it contains our forest fire rules and much of the law
relative to woodland fires. many persons interested in forestry, many of
them from foreign countries, copied the notice verbatim. it is probable
that similar rules and regulations will be incorporated in the forestry
laws of other states and countries.

an attendant was employed at the camp who answered the numerous
questions as to where the various articles of furniture and decoration
might be obtained. much information was also sought by visitors in
relation to the adirondack forests and the summer resorts of new york in
general.

this sportsman's camp was the only exhibit of the kind shown at the
fair. sportsmen and lovers of life in the woods from all parts of the
land visited it; many were ecstatic in its praises; some complimented it
by saying it was the most artistic feature of the whole forestry, fish
and game exhibit. it was photographed perhaps more than one hundred
times during the season and in one instance by nine different persons on
a single day.


animals and birds

the fur and game animals and birds of the state were represented by
mounted specimens prepared by professional taxidermists. in many
instances they were shown in pairs, male and female.

the space in front of the camp and also at one side was inclosed by a
rustic fence built of round spruce. in the yard at the side was placed a
tree about twelve feet high, and under it was prepared an artificial
ground work in imitation of a woodland area after a recent snow storm.
in and about this tree, and forming a part of the picture, were placed
in position, as true to life and natural conditions as possible,
specimens of practically all of the birds that remain with us during the
winter season, as follows:

fur and game animals

all of our fur and game animals were represented as follows:

white-tail or virginia deer
black bear
lynx
wild cat
red fox
gray fox
beaver
raccoon
skunk
otter
fisher
cottontail rabbit
martin
mink
black squirrel
gray squirrel
red squirrel
fox squirrel
flying squirrel
chipmunk
musk rat
opossum
varying hare
porcupine

our deer were represented by a fine buck, a doe mounted in a reclining
position, and a small white doe. arranged among bushes in the snow scene
at the side of the camp this family was most lifelike and pleasing in
appearance. white deer are very unusual, but not unnatural. one of them
is killed in this state about every two years.

moose and elk are introduced animals with us now, and, as it is illegal
to kill any, life size specimens could not well be shown. however, very
good heads were exhibited as a part of the decoration of the camp.
albinos of muskrat and porcupine were exhibited. such freakish specimens
attract more attention than those of usual growth.


rare species

in addition to the animals scheduled above were specimens of some
species that are probably extinct in the adirondacks, viz., a gray wolf
and a panther. the gray wolf was an excellent specimen loaned by general
e. a. mcalpin, of new york city. it was killed about eight years ago on
his preserve in the northern part of hamilton county, and none have been
seen since. the panther was killed about twenty-eight years ago by hon.
verplanck colvin in the southern part of hamilton county, and is the
last one heard of in the state of new york. the black bear was an
unusually fine specimen, killed in sullivan county. it was mounted to
order by mr. fred sauter, of new york city, for this exhibit, and
without doubt was the best representative of this species at the fair.
experts in the art of taxidermy and naturalists were enthusiastic in its
praise.

the great blue heron was loaned by mr. grant e. winchester, of saranac
inn. it was a very good specimen and was mounted by mr. h. h. miner, of
saranac lake, n. y.

the animals were placed about the camp under the trees in connection
with the collection of birds in positions as true to life as possible in
the available space, making a picture of woodland life delightful to the
eye and interesting to every person that visited the palace of forestry,
fish and game.


fish

the fish exhibit consisted of eighty-six mounted specimens, representing
seventy-two species, most of them prepared specially for this display by
the best workmen in the country. substantially all the food and game
fish were shown. in preparing this collection no attempt, with one
exception, was made to show abnormally large specimens. the intention
was to show the average fish true to life in color, size and contour.
both fresh and salt water species were represented. the collection,
which is undoubtedly the best in the country, comprised the following
species:

sea lamphrey
common sturgeon
short-nosed sturgeon
horned pout
long-nose sucker
common sucker
hog sucker
golden sucker
fallfish
carp
eel
sea herring

halibut
sand dab
gar pike


in addition to the above-mentioned specimens there was shown an
interesting collection of shell fish, including different varieties of
oysters, together with the enemies of the same, such as the drill and
starfish. a number of exhibits showing curiosities of oyster growth were
in this collection.

the fish were displayed in six cabinets constructed to order for the
exhibit. they were lined with black plush, thus forming a strong
contrast with the colors of the various pieces.

the land-locked salmon mentioned above is one of the finest pieces
extant, not only in relation to size but also in the mounting of the
same. it is owned by hon. j. p. allds, norwich, n. y., and was kindly
loaned by him for this exhibit.

a great northern pike that weighed twenty-five pounds when caught was in
the collection. it was loaned by mr. ferris j meigs, of new york city,
and was caught in follensbee pond, in the adirondacks, by miss juliet
wilbur tompkins in 1902. this is the largest pike, sometimes erroneously
called pickerel, within the knowledge of the forest, fish and game
commission.


general nomenclature

all the specimens of animals, birds and fish were properly and uniformly
labeled, giving the names the various species are generally known by,
and also the scientific nomenclature adopted by naturalists. the
importance of this matter of nomenclature was demonstrated very early
during the fair. the song birds being very small no labels were placed
upon them at first, as the labels were in some instances larger than the
birds. the fact that visitors examining the specimens would often search
for the attendant in order to obtain information as to the names of the
different birds exhibited proved the necessity of clearly labeling all
specimens. on the other hand there seemed to be a general
misunderstanding as to some species of fish, various names being applied
to the same species. visitors were constantly requesting information on
these points. the northern pike are by many people called pickerel and
sometimes when in water with pickerel are mistaken for muscallonge. the
distinguishing marks were frequently explained to interested visitors.


forestry

one of the most scientific and practical features of the new york
exhibit was that made by the forestry department. it was prepared to
show the method by which the forestry commission is reforesting large
areas of state land that have been denuded by repeated fires.


a forest nursery

the most important part of this was a fully appointed forest nursery,
located out of doors close to the northeast corner of the forest, fish
and game building. its neat rustic fence, made of white cedar poles,
enclosed an area of 7,200 square feet (120 feet long by 60 wide) and
contained about 80,000 little trees alive and green. the soil being of
heavy clay, it was covered to the depth of six inches with good loam
before any seeds were sown.

about one-third of the nursery was arranged in beds each sixteen feet
long by four feet wide with paths three feet in width. in two of these
beds seeds were sown of scotch pine, norway spruce, hardy catalpa and
american elm, half a bed being given to each species. the seeds were
sown about the first of may. they germinated well, and the little trees
grew thriftily, the catalpa reaching a height of eighteen inches before
the fair closed. a bed of norway pine showed the plants on half the bed
crowded together in a thick mat as if grown from seed sown broadcast; on
the other half arranged as if from seed sown in rows across the bed,
both methods of sowing seed being followed in actual practice. four beds
were given to two-year-old plants--norway spruce, white pine, european
larch and scotch pine. these were also arranged as if grown from seed
sown broadcast.

these beds, excepting the seed bed for broad-leaf species, were all
shaded with neat screens made of lath to shelter the tender plants from
the hot rays of the southern sun.

in actual nursery work, after conifers have remained in the seed bed for
two years, they are transplanted into other beds, being spaced four or
five inches apart, where they remain for two or three years more before
they are placed finally in the forest. six beds were devoted to showing
this feature of nursery work. for this purpose four-year-old plants were
used, of the following species norway pine, norway spruce, white spruce,
white pine, european larch and scotch pine.

a sample plantation which occupied nearly half the nursery showed how
the plants are, in actual practice, placed in the forest. white pine,
norway spruce and scotch pine were the species used. these were about
three feet high and were spaced about four feet apart.

to show how the broad-leaf species are raised for shade trees, for
planting along the highways of the state, for farmers' wood lots, for
sugar groves and hardwood forests, ten drills, stretching entirely
across the nursery between the beds and the sample plantation, were
planted with scarlet oak, red oak, honey locust, hard or sugar maple,
red or soft maple, basswood, white ash, black walnut and hardy catalpa,
a row being given to each species. these were one year old and were
spaced about six inches apart.

the names of the species were printed plainly on neat board labels ten
inches long by five inches broad. the nursery was kept free from weeds,
and was watered each evening during a long drought which began about the
first of september and continued till the fair closed.

thousands of people visited the nursery, attracted to it not only by the
beauty of the small green trees arranged in such interesting manner, but
also because of the instruction it afforded in the science of forestry.
foresters, botanists, seedsmen, and others interested in trees in a
scientific or practical way, many of whom were from abroad, gave the
nursery close scrutiny.

the forester in charge who prepared the nursery, mr. a. knechtel,
b.s.f.e., of albany, n. y., was kept constantly busy answering the
numerous questions not only concerning the exhibit, but also in regard
to the important work being done by the forestry department in restoring
the forests upon the denuded non-agricultural lands of the state.

in a corner of the nursery stood two interesting cross-sections of white
pine and white spruce, twenty-three inches and sixteen inches in
diameter respectively, each having forty annual rings plainly visible,
showing that in forty years, under favorable conditions, trees of these
species can be grown from seed to the given diameters.


forestry tools and instruments

within the building were exhibited thirty-nine instruments and tools
used in forestry practice, a collection of the seeds of eighty-four
native forest trees of the state, and the photographs of eighty of our
more important trees showing the same in leaf and in winter. in
connection with each pair of photographs was a life size illustration of
the bark of the tree, together with specimens of the leaf, flower and
fruit.


insects affecting forest and shade trees

the exhibit of insects affecting forest and shade trees was prepared by
e. p. felt, d.sc., new york state entomologist, and was a small, though
representative collection, designed to show the life, history and habits
in particular of the more injurious forms of insects affecting shade and
forest trees in new york state. a special effort was made to depict, so
far as possible, the life, history, habits and methods of work of the
forms possessing economic importance and to show whenever possible the
natural enemies of value in keeping these species in control. this
collection was arranged in a specially designed case having a series of
three nearly horizontal trays thirty-seven and one-half inches by
eighteen and one-half inches upon each side, and an elevated central
portion bearing two nearly perpendicular ones upon each side, the middle
being occupied by a glass case containing an attractive natural group. a
brief account of the exhibit under appropriate heads is as follows:

_insect galls_. this collection, occupying two nearly perpendicular
trays and representing the work of fifty-three species, was devoted to
the peculiar and varied vegetable deformities produced by insects. these
structures are always of great popular interest, and the insects causing
the same present biologic problems of unusual attractiveness.

_forest insects_. the species affecting forest trees in particular
were exhibited in three horizontal trays occupying one side of the case.
this section was devoted principally to representing the biology and
methods of work of this exceedingly important group.

_shade-tree insects_. like that representing forest insects, the
exhibit of shade-tree pests was very largely biologic. it occupied three
horizontal trays and a nearly vertical one of the exhibit case, and was
devoted to species which are destructive largely on account of their
depredations upon shade trees.

_adirondack insects_. this was a small collection occupying one of
the nearly perpendicular trays, and comprised over one hundred species.
this portion of the exhibit represented the more characteristic forms
occurring in the adirondacks.

_natural group of forest insects_. this group occupied the central
glass box and contained thirty-one species of insects or representations
of their work upon wax models of their food plants, namely, white birch,
red oak, elm and maple. eleven species of beetles, fifteen of
butterflies and moths, two of the bee family and three of the bug family
were to be seen upon the plants or on the ground at their base. this
group gave an excellent idea of the appearance of insects when amid
their natural surroundings.


colored plates

a series of quarto and octavo colored plates illustrating the work and
various stages of some of the more important depredators upon forest and
shade trees, was exhibited in two double-faced frames attached to the
top of this case. the more important insects included in this group were
the following: sugar maple borer, elm snout beetles, twig girdler or
twig pruner, white marked tussock moth, gypsy moth, brown tail moth, bag
worm, forest tent caterpillar, elm leaf beetle, oyster scale, scurfy
bark louse, san jose scale, elm bark louse, cottony maple scale. one
plate was devoted to characteristic insects affecting oak, and another
to those depredating upon hard pine.


specimens of native woods

the forest product of the state was represented by a collection of
specimens of all the native woods of new york, built into panel work,
showing both sides. each species was represented by two specimens and
each of the four surfaces was finished in a different manner. one
surface was highly polished, one oiled, one planed and one rough.
ninety-one species of native and nine species of introduced woods were
exhibited in this manner. displaying the several species in four
different ways enabled the discriminating observer to study and compare
the various woods profitably. the manner of labeling was greatly
appreciated. some students copied all the labels, each spending many
hours on this task.

the kinds of timber that grow in this state from which a five-inch board
can be sawed and which were represented as described, are as follows:

cucumber tree
tulip tree
basswood
linden
holly

these specimens of wood were built into panel work in seven frames of
the following seven species of wood, respectively:

maple
cherry
chestnut
rock elm
white oak
black ash
black birch


labeling of specimens

each specimen was labeled on both sides, with the common or popular name
and also the botanical name. most of the pieces were from a collection
that the commission exhibited at the paris exposition in 1900, which was
there awarded a gold medal. in preparing the exhibit the collection was
enlarged so as to represent all our native woods, and built into new
frame work of substantial and attractive design.

a complete collection of the several kinds of wood pulp manufactured in
new york was also a part of the exhibit, as follows:

ground spruce pulp
sulphite spruce pulp
sulphite balsam pulp
sulphite poplar pulp
sulphite basswood pulp
pulverized pine pulp
pulverized poplar pulp

ground and sulphite pulp is used in the manufacture of paper and many
household articles of utility. pulverized pulp is used in making
linoleum and dynamite.

although wood pulp was shown in some other exhibits, no one else made
any attempt to show a complete collection of all the various kinds of
pulp manufactured.

articles of utility made of pulp, such as wash tubs, pails, measures,
cups, pitchers, etc., fifty-three pieces in all, were shown in
connection with the display of pulp.


by-products of the forest

by-products of the forest were also displayed on a piece of circular
shelving with a suitable caption. the articles in this collection were
as follows:

crude wood alcohol
refined wood alcohol
columbian spirits
acetic acid
refined acetic acid
glacial acetic acid
acetate of lime
gray acetate of lime
pine needle extract
light wood tar
heavy wood tar

hazel nuts
maple sugar (cakes)
maple lozenges
maple kisses
maple sugar (pulverized)
maple syrup
mocker nuts
butter nuts
sassafras
witch hazel

there was no other exhibit of this nature at the fair.


summer resorts

on one side of the space occupied by the exhibit was a high wall which
was covered with green burlap. on this wall were three groups of large
photographs, one of the thousand islands, one of adirondack and one of
catskill scenery.

in the thousand island group in addition to a collection of typical
island scenery, was a large picture of the thousand island house at
alexandria bay, n. y., furnished by the owner, o. g. staples; a picture
of the hotel frontenac on round island loaned by the owner, and a very
large colored picture of the excursion steamer "ramona," on tour through
the islands, loaned by the thousand island steamboat company, cape
vincent, n. y.

the catskill pictures consisted of photographs of mountain scenery and
waterfalls, prepared specially for this exhibit. a fine group of scenes
was furnished by the catskill mountain railroad of catskill, n. y.,
showing the otis elevated road, the mountain house, etc.

the group of adirondack views contained pictures of a number of the
largest hotels in that region, and collections of mountain and water
scenery. one group was of lake george scenery. a large picture of
wawbeek hotel, on upper saranac lake, was furnished by j. ben hart, of
wawbeek, n. y. the delaware and hudson railroad company kindly loaned a
large panoramic picture of lake placid and mountains of that locality.

many of these pictures were in colors. they were appreciated by a great
number of people that had visited the several summer resorts
represented.


an open hunting camp

a model of a hunting camp of the open style, of which there are many in
the adirondacks, was displayed. it was constructed of spruce with the
bark on, and the floor was covered with balsam boughs, which exhaled a
delightful odor noticeable several yards from the camp.

a large rustic table made of a cross section of a cedar tree with the
roots of a tree for the standard and legs of the table, was loaned by
mr. ferris j. meigs, of tupper lake, n. y. the tree from which the cross
section was taken showed by its growth of rings that it was more than
four hundred years old.


details of expenditure

for the purpose of making this state forestry, fish and game exhibit,
the louisiana purchase exposition commission generously set aside the
sum of $18,000. being unable to secure as much space as was needed, and
for the additional reason that the salaries of some of the persons
collaborating on the exhibit were provided for in another manner, it was
not necessary to use all of the funds available.

dividing the disbursements into ten representative accounts, the amount
expended was as follows:
animals and birds -------------------------   $2,211 56
    fish ----------------------------------    1,792 51
    insects -------------------------------      644 52
    plants for nursery, etc. --------------      392 69
    woods, instruments, by-products, etc. -    1,119 28
    sportsman's camp and furnishings ------    1,507 92
    wall pictures -------------------------      278 93
    freight and express -------------------      697 10
    installation --------------------------    2,481 76
    maintenance and repacking -------------    3,717 81
                                           ------------
total -------------------------------------  $14,844 08
                                           ------------

had the exhibit been prepared without recourse to materials on hand and
by a separate force paid from the funds of the louisiana purchase
exposition commission it would have undoubtedly cost the state not less
than $20,000, but the fact that considerable material was available from
former exhibits, and from the office of the forest, fish and game
commission, and the further fact, as above stated, that some of the
collaborators received their compensation from the funds of that
commission, enabled the state to make the elaborate and exhaustive
exhibit that it did in this department at the figures shown above.


the roster

the exhibit was prepared under the direction of colonel william f. fox,
superintendent state forests.

following is a roster of the persons employed at the exhibit:

arthur b. strough, special agent in charge
abraham knechtel, forester
charles c. hembree, attendant
victor mahlstedt, gardener


awards

the awards were all conferred upon the forest, fish and game commission
or upon state officials. the juries in the departments of forestry, fish
and game were made up of eminent specialists, and their work was done in
a thorough and painstaking manner. they expressed themselves in
complimentary terms on the various features of the exhibit, and the
result of their deliberations cannot but be gratifying to all who are
interested in the advanced work of the empire state in forestry, in
forest preserves and in the protection of our native fish and game.

a summary of the awards is as follows:
three grand prizes
three gold medals
six silver medals

the exhibit in this department differed somewhat from the state exhibits
in other departments in that, with the exception of a very few articles,
which were loaned by private parties to complete or supplement the
collections, the showing was exclusively a state exhibit.


some surprising facts

the exhibit as a whole was immensely popular from the very first day.
the people visiting the exposition were largely from the southern and
middle western states, and seemed very generally to believe that new
york's forests, fish and game has passed away with the advance of
civilization. most of them were greatly surprised to learn that
one-fourth of the state is wild land, which will in all probability
always be devoted largely to forests, and that the state has so many
wild deer that 6,000 of them are killed annually without any apparent
decrease of the number.

the sportsman's camp served the purpose of advertising the great
adirondack region as a summer resort, and a great many visitors
expressed their intention of visiting that locality in the near future.

probably one of the best features of the exhibit was the work shown by
the commission in progressive forestry. this state being in the van of
the forestry movement was looked to to point out the path of
professional forestry, and if no other award had been made than the
grand prize by the scientific jury that served in that department, we
would feel as though our efforts has been appreciated and that our
labors had not been in vain.

chapter xiv

mines and metallurgy exhibit and schedule of awards


mines and metallurgy exhibit by h. h. hindshaw special agent of the
state museum

[illustration]

as in previous expositions at which the state of new york has been an
exhibitor, the scientific exhibits were made through the organization of
the state museum. dr. f. j. h. merrill, the director of the museum,
assigned to the writer the duty of preparing the exhibit to be made
under his direction. the available time and money entered largely into
the settlement of the question of what form the exhibit should take.


scope of exhibit

it was thought best to confine the scope of the main exhibit to the
technologic and commercial aspects of geology and mineralogy. a
judicious selection of materials made to show the mineral wealth of the
state was considered more desirable than to make merely a large display.
many of the materials exhibited were taken from the state museum
collections, supplemented where necessary by such additions as could be
obtained within the required time.

the benefit derived by the state from such exhibits is often much more
apparent than that which is to be derived by the individual exhibitors,
and on this account the commission is particularly indebted to those
firms and individuals which went to considerable expense in preparing
exhibits along lines which were intended more to represent all phases of
an industry rather than to show the products of a single firm.

those deserving especial mention in this connection are the solvay
process company, of syracuse; the h. h. mathews consolidated slate
company, of boston; the helderberg cement company, of howes cave; the
hudson river bluestone company, of new york; the medina sandstone
company, of new york, and the united states gypsum company, of chicago.


installation

the cases used were taken from the museum, and suitable stands for the
building stone and other exhibits were constructed in albany. on account
of the weight of the specimens exhibited the floor had to be
strengthened. this work, as well as the building of platforms and
partitions, was done under contract by messrs. caldwell and drake.

the exhibits of mineral resources may be divided into the metallic and
non-metallic groups.


iron

in the first division in our state, iron is by far the most important
and probably the one with which the people of the state are least
acquainted. a few years ago new york stood near the head of the iron
producing states. the depression in the iron industries, commencing
about 1888, and the discovery about that time of the seemingly
inexhaustible deposits of rich ores in the lake superior region,
however, resulted in shutting down nearly all of our mines. for the last
few years little attention has been paid to them, and they seem to have
been popularly supposed to have been worked out. the exposition gave an
opportunity of showing this supposition to be incorrect, and recent
investigations show that the deposits are of much greater extent and
value than was known in the eighties. with but one or two exceptions
none of the mines then worked are exhausted, and immense bodies of
valuable ore have not been touched. most of the non-mining localities
were represented by specimens from the museum collections. messrs.
witherbee, sherman & company exhibited a series of ores and concentrates
from mineville, the arnold mining company, magnetites and martite from
arnold hill, and the chateaugay ore and iron company, specimens from
lyon mountain.


magnetite

a series of magnetite and associated rocks from the tilly foster and
other mines were supplemented by a model of the tilly foster mine which
was loaned to the museum for this purpose by the columbia school of
mines.


hematites

the st. lawrence and jefferson county hematites were represented by
large specimens of ore and by a series of associated rocks and minerals,
including some beautiful specimens of millerite, chalcedite, etc. these
hematites are mined in a belt about thirty miles long reaching from
philadelphia, jefferson county, into hermon, st. lawrence county. they
are known as the antwerp red hematites, and, being very easily smelted,
are mixed with more refractory ores.

the clinton or fossil ores extend in a belt across the central part of
the state and are mined in the vicinity of clinton, oneida county, and
in ontario and wayne counties.

the limonites shown from dutchess and columbia counties included some
fine specimens of stalactitic ore.

carbonate ores were shown from columbia and ulster counties, where there
are extensive deposits on both sides of the hudson river.


magnetic separator

a feature of the iron ore exhibit was a magnetic separator supplied by
the wetherill separator company, of new york. this was kept at work on
the magnetite ores from mineville, and was of great interest not only in
showing the method of concentrating the magnetic ore, but also in saving
the phosphorus which occurs in the form of the mineral apatite and which
is of considerable value in the manufacture of fertilizers. a large
quantity of ore was donated for this purpose by messrs. witherbee,
sherman & company.


lead

lead, generally associated with zinc and sometimes copper, has been
mined on a small scale from very early times in ulster and sullivan
counties, and more recently in st. lawrence county. many other
localities have yielded small quantities of these minerals.

a set of specimens was exhibited by the ellenville zinc company,
consisting of strikingly beautiful crystalline masses of quartz galina,
sphalerite and chalcopyrite and specimens of the rare mineral, brookite.
there was also shown in the same case concentrates from the ellenville
mine of lead, zinc and copper made both by jigging and by magnetic
separation, and a collection of ores and associated minerals and rocks
from rossie and wurtzboro.


non-metallic minerals

a large part of this exhibit consisted of construction materials, stone,
slate, brick, tiling and cement. most of the building stone was
exhibited in the form of ten-inch cubes arranged on three pyramidal
stands. only a few of these were especially collected for this
exposition. many more which were considered desirable could not be
obtained in time on account of the inclement weather conditions of the
preceding winter.


granites

the granitic rocks included granite, gneisses, syenites and norite. this
series only inadequately represented the new york granites. among the
most striking examples shown were the coarse grained red granite from
grindstone island in the st. lawrence river, the mohican granite from
peekskill, westchester county, which is being extensively used in the
cathedral of st. john the divine in new york city, and the dark green
labradorite rock known as the ausable granite from keeseville, essex
county. there are many interesting granite deposits, especially in the
adirondack region, which have not been developed.


marbles

the marbles included some fine examples of decorative stone from south
dover, dutchess county, the black marble from glens falls, monumental
and building marbles from gouverneur, st. lawrence county, and white
building marbles from southeastern new york.


limestones

limestones of excellent quality are quarried in a great number of
localities and were well represented, some of them showing as fine a
polished surface as the true marbles.


sandstones

the state is also rich in sandstones of good quality. the potsdam
sandstone forms an almost complete belt around the adirondacks and is an
excellent building stone. its color is from white to pale red, and in
many places it is an extremely hard quartzite. specimens were shown from
potsdam, st. lawrence county.

the white sandstones of washington county have been extensively used for
refractory purposes in the manufacture of steel, being almost free from
iron. the medina sandstones are quarried in the neighborhood of medina,
albion and lockport. while a pure white stone occurs at lewiston, the
medina stone is generally of a pinkish red color. it is extensively used
as a building stone, particularly in buffalo and rochester. it is
valuable for paving, curbing and flagging. the medina sandstone company
exhibited a piece of wall work to show the various methods of finish,
including a finely carved lintel. a number of cubes were exhibited from
various quarries.

the sandstones of southern new york occurring in the rocks of devonian
age are generally fine grained and blue or greenish in color and are
known as bluestones. most of the quarries are in the counties of greene,
ulster, broome, delaware and sullivan. they are described in new york
state museum bulletin 61 by harold t. dickinson. there is a great
variety in color and physical properties of stone from these quarries.
it is used as building stone and for trimming, and some of it is
especially valuable for large platforms. a large proportion of the
output is in the form of flagging and curbstone.

the hudson river bluestone company exhibited a piece of wall built into
the base of the pyramidal stand holding the sandstone cubes. this was
designed to show the ease with which it can be worked and included some
finely carved lettering. the main entrance to the exhibit was paved with
flags and tiles of this material.


slate

with the sandstones were shown some ten-inch cubes of slate cut from the
quarries of the h. h. mathews consolidated slate company, of boston,
which operates a number of quarries in washington county. the slate belt
covers an area of about 320 square miles, the larger part of which is in
washington county, n. y., but which extends across the line into rutland
county, vt. this is probably the richest slate region in the world. the
beds are of great thickness, belonging to two distinct geologic
formations. they are folded on one another in such a manner as to
present the workable beds in long parallel ridges.

on account of its great strength and easy working qualities new uses are
constantly being found for slate. one of the most striking features of
the slate exhibit was a mantel built of rough slabs of dark red slate
showing the cross fracture to have a fine satiny texture. this was a
copy of a mantel designed by lord & hewlet, of new york, and built in a
poultney, vt., residence. the main slate exhibit consisted of a stand
supporting a slated roof, one side of which was covered with unfading
green slates one inch thick, such as were laid on senator clark's new
york residence. the other side was covered with rough thick slabs of
unfading red. the sides of the stand were covered with the regular trade
slates in four sections--red, green, purple and variegated. the uses of
slate for construction purposes were shown by slabs and panels on the
upper part of the stand.


cement

the cement exhibit was made by the helderberg cement company, of howes
cave. one side of the exhibit stand was devoted to portland and the
other to natural cements. barrels and bags of finished cement formed the
base of the structure on which were glass jars containing the rock in
its stages of manufacture, with a series of photographs of the works and
of buildings of cement. on account of the rapidly extending applications
of cement a large section outside of the building was set aside for
exhibits of the uses of cement, and the exhibit was designed mainly to
show the manufacture, the materials used and the method of their
treatment.


gypsum

gypsum was shown by a fine series of specimens contributed by the united
states gypsum company from their mines in western new york. this
material, like cement, is rapidly being adapted for a variety of
purposes, especially in the finish and ornamentation of buildings, and
the exhibit, encased in one of the square plate glass museum cases with
its cut and polished cubes of raw gypsum, selenite crystals, jars of
stucco colors and examples of plaster casts, made a very attractive
exhibit. in another case there was exhibited gypsum in various forms
from other sources.


salt

the salt exhibit was made up from a very complete set of specimens in
sample jars taken from the museum collections, and a large number of
packages from the manufacturers. the salt of new york is obtained from
the salina formation in the western part of the state. the industry is
of great importance. the deposits are described in state museum bulletin
11 by dr. f. j. h. merrill. one of the most interesting varieties shown
was the solar salt, which has been made on the onondaga salt
reservation, syracuse, since 1788. blocks of rock salt were shown from
the retsof and livonia shafts.

most of the salt produced, however, is from wells bored down through the
rock salt beds, and is pumped up in the form of brine and evaporated by
artificial heat.


solvay process company

the solvay process company, of syracuse, made a splendid display of soda
ash. the plant of this company uses an immense amount of salt which is
obtained from the tully districts and carried by pipes to solvay. the
raw materials used were shown in the lower sections of two cases
especially constructed for the exhibit, which also held a set of barrels
and other packages in which the soda is shipped. in the upper sections
were shown a series of large glass jars with the various products. these
were supplied with a series of labels completely describing the process
of manufacture and the chemical changes which take place. above the case
there was a set of photographs of the works, illustrating the social
life of the work-people employed and the growth of the establishment.


useful minerals

the exhibit of the useful minerals of the state was principally prepared
by h. p. whitlock of the museum staff. one case contained a set of the
abrasive materials, the most important of these being garnet, which is
found in great quantities in the adirondacks. crude garnet from several
mines, the ground and cleaned garnet, and grades of garnet paper were
shown. a small millstone to represent the celebrated esopus grit, emery
ore from peekskill, and quartz and sand from many localities were also
exhibited in this case. another case was filled with feldspar, mica and
quartz, which usually occur associated with each other in the form of
pegmetite dikes in the crystalline rocks of the adirondacks and the
highlands of the hudson. these materials are not as yet very extensively
mined but an increasing demand for them is bringing to light many
promising localities.


graphite

another valuable mineral which occurs in the state in great quantities
is graphite. specimens of both the crude ore and manufactured graphite
were exhibited. the deposits of this material in the form of graphitic
limestone cover miles of territory, but more satisfactory processes for
its concentration are needed to make it available for use, especially in
the higher grades.


museum publications

the museum exhibited a set of its publications on geologic subjects, a
set of published maps and maps specially prepared for this exhibit to
show the distribution of useful minerals, and a number of enlarged
photographs.


paleontology

the exhibit of the department of paleontology consisted of a set of its
publications on the paleontology of the state of new york--35
volumes--covering the period 1847-1904, and a set of wing frames with
many of the original drawings and plates used in their illustration.


special features

the most striking feature of the exhibit was an immense slab of potsdam
sandstone from bidwell's crossing, clinton county, which was part of the
premoidial or cambrian beach laid down about the shores of the
adirondack continental nucleus. the slab shows the trails of animals
crossing in all directions, especially those known as clemactechnites,
said by dr. j. m. clarke to have been made by a a simple primitive type
of mollusk. the slab, weighing over fifteen tons, was moved in six
sections and put together for exhibition.

restorations in plaster of paris of the fossil crustaceous eurypterus
and hughmilleria were also exhibited.


clays

the exhibition of clays and clay products was made by the state school
of ceramics, at alfred, n. y., under the direction of professor charles
f. binns, and included some large vases, the work of students.

the state of new york has long held an important place in the brick
trade on account of its unlimited quantities of clay along the hudson
river, which have not only supplied much of the brick used for building
in new york city, but bricks have been shipped from this source long
distances by water. the finer varieties of clay have not been worked to
any extent except on long island, but other conditions have resulted in
the establishment of potteries at brooklyn, syracuse and other points,
using almost exclusively clays imported into the state. the beds of
feldspar and flint now being exploited in the adirondacks will
materially help to put this class of potteries on a firmer basis.

the center of the exhibition space was devoted to a pagoda designed to
show the kinds of brick manufactured in the principal localities. the
roof afforded an excellent place to exhibit earthenware tiling.

the general electric company exhibited a case of insulators, many of
them of special types, from their schenectady pottery. insulators were
also exhibited by pass & seymour, of syracuse, and the empire china
works, of brooklyn.


petroleum

the petroleum exhibit was made under the general direction of secretary
and chief executive officer charles a. ball. an extensive series of
crude and refined oils and by-products occupied a case showing on both
sides. on this was installed a model of a tower and drilling machinery
such as is used in sinking oil wells. the records printed on the labels
furnished data which made an important addition to our previous
knowledge of the new york oil fields.

in addition to those heretofore mentioned, the following gentlemen
assisted as indicated in the preparation of the exhibit, and are
entitled to no small credit for the valuable assistance rendered.

e. e. engelhardt was engaged in the acquisition of the salt exhibits.

j. s. bellamy collected the petroleum exhibit under the immediate
direction of secretary ball.

c. f. binns collected the exhibit of clay products under the immediate
direction of the state commission.

w. c. richard assisted in installing the exhibit.

frederick braun installed the slab of potsdam sandstone.

the following members of the staff of the state museum also assisted:
h.s. mattimore, c.a. trask, e.c. kenny, d.d. luther and joseph morje.

chapter xv

social economy exhibit and schedule of awards


social economy exhibit by delancey m. ellis director of education and
social economy


the department of social economy being closely allied with the
department of education, and its exhibit being installed in the palace
of education, it was placed under the general charge of the director of
education, whose title was changed to the director of education and
social economy.


appropriations

the following appropriations were made for exhibits in this department:

state commission in lunacy, ------------ $1,800
state board of charities, --------------  1,200
state department of prisons, -----------  2,000
state department of labor, -------------  1,000
craig colony for epileptics, sonyea, ---    500
general expenses, ----------------------  1,000
                                        -------
total, --------------------------------- $7,500
                                        -------

from the last named appropriation was paid the expenses for the exhibits
of the state department of health and the state department of excise,
and such other institutions or associations as were properly included in
this class.


preparation of exhibits

all of the exhibits of state departments were prepared by the
departments contributing them, and in the case of the state commission
in lunacy and the state board of charities the exhibits were installed
by a special representative. this also is true of the exhibit of the
state department of prisons, which required the constant attendance of
an expert to demonstrate its workings.

during the latter part of the exposition period william t. arms, an
attache of the state building, was detailed to the department of social
economy, and dividing his time among the several state exhibits, added
materially to the pleasure and knowledge of visitors concerning new
york's institutions.


plan of arrangement

the exposition authorities determined that the exhibits in the
department of social economy should be collective; that is, that all the
work in the department of charities and corrections from whatever source
should be installed together; the same to be true of general betterment
movements, hygiene, municipal improvement, etc. this plan precluded the
installation of the state's exhibit in this department in one place with
a dignified installation, as in the other exhibit departments, and made
necessary the placing of the exhibit in several different parts of the
building according to the subdivision of the classification under which
it fell. perhaps from the standard of general utility the arrangement
was all that could be desired, but from the standpoint of the state it
is of doubtful value, as such a disposition of the state's exhibit made
no single part of it of any considerable size, nor as impressive as had
the state's work in this department been shown together.

no state in the union approaches the empire state in its progressive
policy in the care of the insane, the destitute and delinquents, in the
solving of labor and excise problems, and had the exhibit in this
department been installed together, a most effective and striking lesson
would have been taught.


state commission in lunacy

the exhibit of the new york state commission in lunacy was the most
suggestive and comprehensive of any shown in the department for the
insane, and was designed primarily to show the difference between the
ancient and modern methods of treating these unfortunates. two rooms
were shown, the first of which represented the primitive methods adopted
for treating insanity. the room was barren, dark and not over clean. at
the front was shown one of the old peep-doors taken from the utica
asylum. it was of massive construction and contained a small aperture
covered by a heavy wooden blind, through which the attendant could
observe the doings of the patient, or, more properly speaking, the
prisoner. within stood one of the so-called utica cribs built of heavy
wood, over which was a cover of wooden bars. in this crib the patient
was obliged to remain in a recumbent position, the cover closed and
locked. near by stood a restraining chair, a whirling chair, a straight
jacket and shackles, all representing ancient methods of "quieting" the
victims of the dread disease.

adjoining was an airy room, clean and inviting, made cheerful by growing
plants and attractive furniture, with every modern appliance for the
care of an invalid, resembling closely a room of the better class in a
general hospital. there was an entire absence of any kind of restraint.
a neat iron bedstead, rocking chairs, invalid table, wash stand, book
case with books, and in fact every comfort and convenience was at hand.
in this room were also shown the uniforms worn by the nurses and
attendants in the state hospitals for the insane, and a series of
reference books upon the subject of insanity, the exhibit was
supplemented by a series of handsome photographs completely illustrating
the various state hospitals for the insane, the daily life of the
inmates and the expert attention which they receive.

glass cases contained a large amount of industrial work done by the
inmates. this chiefly consisted of sewing and embroidery. a feature of
the exhibit was an oak cabinet containing a series of specimens showing
cross sections of the brain prepared at the pathological institute in
new york city. it was of decided scientific value and interest. near by
was a miniature tent hospital, a complete model of the hospital for the
care of insane patients afflicted with tuberculosis which is now in
operation at the manhattan state hospital, ward's island, n. y.

a striking feature was a copy of the famous oil painting, "dr. pinel
freeing the insane at la salpetriere after the close of the french
revolution." it most graphically told the story of the complete
revolution in treating this dread disease.


state board of charities

the exhibit of the state board of charities was installed under four
different subdivisions of group 139 (charities and corrections) of the
official classification.

1. class 784. destitute, neglected and delinquent children
2. class 785. institutional care of destitute adults
3. class 787. hospitals, dispensaries and nursing
4. class 789. treatment of criminals

the exhibit of the board in the department for the care of juvenile
delinquents was comprehensive in its make up. photographs of the various
state institutions devoted to this purpose were shown, clearly
demonstrating the superiority of these institutions as to buildings,
equipment and maintenance. these photographs were supplemented by an
exhibit of industrial work of the inmates.

the state industrial school at rochester and the house of refuge for
juvenile delinquents at randall's island both contributed some
exceptional work in wood carving and wrought iron.

in addition to this were shown the uniforms worn in the different
institutions and also specimens of the scholastic work which the
children are doing.

the state board of charities also assumed the responsibility for, and
partially prepared, the exhibit of various charity organization
societies within the state, by far the most elaborate of which was the
exhibit of the charity organization society of new york city. by means
of photographs, administrative blanks and reports the great work which
this organization is doing was clearly revealed.

the work of the board in the care of destitute adults was demonstrated
by means of a complete set of photographs of the county alms houses of
the state of new york. from two to four pictures of each institution
were shown, giving a very clear idea of their scope and equipment. these
photographs were supplemented by a statistical blank containing valuable
data as to the value of the plant, number of employees, of inmates, and
such other information as would be useful to the public.

the exhibit of the work of the board as related to general hospitals of
the state consisted largely of a series of photographs, supplemented by
valuable statistical matter.

the board also prepared an exhibit from the various state prisons, the
industrial work of which is under the jurisdiction of the state prison
commission. this exhibit contained photographs of the members of the
state prison commission, photographs showing the interiors of the
different prisons, reports, etc., and revealed the fact that the empire
state is in the front rank in inaugurating reform movements looking
toward the health, safety and moral uplift of the inmates.


state department of prisons

the exhibit of the state department of prisons probably received as much
attention from the public as any single state exhibit prepared. it
consisted of a demonstration of the workings of the bertillon and finger
print systems for the identification of criminals. an ornate
installation of solid oak, handsomely carved, was built by the inmates
of the state prison at ossining, and was carried to st. louis and
erected upon the space assigned to this department.

throughout the season captain j.h. parke, an expert on the finger print
system, and e.e. davis, jr., an expert on the bertillon system, were
present to demonstrate the workings of these systems to exposition
visitors. but few are familiar with the operations of the bertillon
system, and the finger print system is as yet practically unknown.

new york state is the pioneer state of the union in putting into
practical operation the finger print system for the identification of
criminals, and it is the only state in which it is at present in use.
although there is a national bureau of identification at washington, d.
c., which is conducted through the co-operation of the chiefs of police
of many of the large cities throughout the country, it cannot be said to
be a department of the united states government, and its system is far
from as perfect as that of the empire state.


state department of labor

probably in no state of the union does there exist a labor department
organized upon such extensive lines as is that of the state of new york.
recently three bureaus were merged forming the state department of
labor. these were the bureau of labor statistics, the board of mediation
and arbitration and the office of the factory inspector. the exhibit
consisted of a complete set of reports of these various bureaus, and of
the department erected therefrom, supplemented with a series of graphic
charts bearing upon every phase of the labor question, and comparing the
economic condition of the empire state with that of other states of the
union and various foreign countries. the exhibit was a valuable
sociological contribution. an especially strong feature was four
monographs, entitled "typical employers' welfare institutions in new
york," "labor legislation in new york," "the work of the state
department of labor," and "the growth of industry in new york." these
were printed in such quantities as to permit of their distribution among
visitors to the exposition. the graphic charts were reproduced in
half-tones and inserted in the monographs.

the exhibit was carefully studied by students of sociology generally as
it is recognized that the state of new york speaks with a voice of
authority upon questions of this nature.


state department of excise

the question of controlling the liquor traffic is one of lively interest
throughout the civilized world. the exhibit of the state department of
excise was so prepared as to clearly demonstrate the superiority of the
system of state control in licensing this traffic as administered under
the new york state liquor tax law. the exhibit consisted of a series of
graphic charts showing this statute's moral benefit to the people of the
state by reducing the number of drinking places more than twenty per
cent and increasing the amount collected from liquor licenses from about
three million to about eighteen million dollars annually. by means of a
key, which accompanied the charts, the visitor was enabled easily to
trace the development of the law since its first enactment and to see
the efficiency with which it is enforced.


state department of health

the exhibit of the state department of health was made up of a complete
set of reports of the department, supplemented by administrative blanks
used in the enforcement of the health law, and photographs showing the
offices of the department, the anti-toxin laboratory and other features
of the department's work. a full set of blanks used in the collection of
vital statistics and sample specimens of anti-toxin and anti-tetanus,
which are distributed without charge by the department, completed the
exhibit.


craig colony

the exhibit of craig colony consisted of a model designed to show the
ideal institution for the care, education and treatment of epileptics,
towards which craig colony in its development is working. the model was
skillfully constructed and cost considerably more than the appropriation
made by the commission, the balance being paid from private sources.


miscellaneous exhibits

the new york state exhibit in the department of social economy also
contained an exhibit of the woman's institute at yonkers, a
philanthropic organization providing for the care of needy families in
their homes and promoting several general betterment movements. the
exhibit consisted of photographs, blanks and statistics bearing upon the
work of the organization.

close by was an exhibit of the george junior republic at freeville, a
unique institution for the care of juvenile delinquents and carried on
along the lines of a civic organization. the exhibit consisted of
interesting photographs showing the buildings and the plant, also
specimens of blanks and samples of the money in use in the institution,
and a general account of the work since its inception.

one of the most interesting exhibits was that of the bank of new york,
new york city, which is one of the oldest banks in the united states,
having been organized in 1784 and having since enjoyed a most prosperous
career. in addition to photographs, original by-laws and figures
concerning the present condition of the bank, was exhibited the first
ledger of the institution, which contained the accounts of aaron burr,
robert r. livingston and other noted contemporaries. in addition were
shown requisitions of alexander hamilton, then secretary of the
treasury, for loans to the government, and other interesting historical
documents.

the state library prepared and exhibited an interesting compilation of
sociological legislation and literature which was designed to show the
advanced work done by the library in that direction.

exhibits were also in place from the church association for the
advancement of the interests of labor; the eastman kodak company, of
rochester, n. y.; the blacksmith and wheelwright; the sugar trade
review, and a volume published by the mercantile publishing company
containing a directory of manufacturers and valuable trade statistics.
