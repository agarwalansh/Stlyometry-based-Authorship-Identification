

new year's day.

hail! joyous morn. hail! happy day,
that ushers in another year,
fraught with what sorrow, none can say,
nor with what pain, to mortals here.

another year has roll'd away,
with all its sorrows, joys and fears,
but still the light of hope's glad ray,
yet beams within our heart, and cheers.

one year, one span of time has pass'd,
so swift to some, to others slow;
but it has gone, and we should cast
along with it, remorse and woe.

of things we've done, or only thought,
'tis useless now the bitter tear,
of actions unavailing wrought,
let them repose upon their bier.

we should, indeed, e'en yet atone
for what our reason says we can,
but never let remorse's groan
degrade us from our state as man.

let us discharge the debts we owe,
but still some debts will be unpaid;
but we, if we forgive, also,
should ne'er, despairing, feel afraid.

the future is before us still,
and to that future we should gaze,
with hope renew'd, with firmer will,
to tread life's weary, tangl'd maze.

we ne'er should let the gloomy past,
bow down our heads in dark despair,
but we should keep those lessons fast,
which e'en our follies taught us there.

experience, so dearly bought,
by folly, or by ignorance,
should, in our inmost system wrought,
our daily life improve, advance.

then let us press towards the goal,
the common goal of all mankind,
go on, while seasons onward roll,
nor cast one fainting look behind.

and, as we journey through this year,
let us in watchfulness beware
of all that brings remorseful tear,
or future terror and despair.

let us with thoughtful vision scan
each step we take, each act we do,
that we may meet our brother man,
with no unrighteous thing to rue.

a happy, happy, bright new year,
i wish to all the sons of men,
with happy hearts, and merry cheer,
till it has roll'd its round again.

imprison'd songster, thou for me
hath warbl'd many a cheerful lay,
thy songs, so sweetly glad and free,
revive my heart, from day to day.

the frost is keen, the wind is cold,
no wild-bird twitters from the spray,
but, still resounding as of old,
thy voice thrills forth, and seems to say:

"wake up! o sadden'd mortal, wake!
shake off that anxious, careworn frown,
thy hopes renew, fresh courage take,
nor let your troubles weigh you down.

"see, i am happy all alone,
and, kept behind the prison bars,
i sing, and shouldst thou ever moan?
--a mortal free, beneath the stars.

"i fly around my narrow cage,

but cheerfully i sing and fly,
beneath my narrow prison's dome.

"oh, list, sad mortal to my song,
and, while thou hearest, mark it well,
and go thy cheerful way along,
nor pray to know, what none can tell.

"i'll sing my song each day for thee,
and live the moments as they fly,
with gladden'd heart, with sounding glee,
and thou shouldst do the same as i."

to a young lady.

short is the time, my friend, since i
first heard thy voice, first saw thy face,
and yet, the days in gliding by,
have left within my mind a trace--
a friendly trace of thee and thine,
which i am sure will long remain
within my heart, to cheer and shine
with other joys, to lessen pain.
it is my hope, also, that thou
may, in thy heart, and on thy tongue,
have thoughts and words for him, who now
is yours so friendly, t. f. young.


kelvin.

while poets sing in lofty strain,
 and ask where rome and carthage are,
this humble village on the plain,
 to many hearts is dearer far.

then to these hearts i'll sing my lay,
 with humble kelvin for my theme;
my song shall be of life to-day,
 and not a retrospective dream.

of "kelvin's grove," some love-lorn swain
 sang sweetly, many years ago,
and i shall sound the name again,
 although i may not sound it so.

of kelvin's bonnie lasses, i
 can sing, tho' not so well as he,
and kelvin's groves, in passing by,
 i can repeat, have charms for me.

and kelvin's stream, where fishes glide,
 and timid fowl their plumage lave,
where drooping willows by its side,
 their graceful branches gently wave.

here happiness and plenty reign,
 and e'en refinement, too, is seen.
for music sends its cheering strain,
 where flowers grow within the green.

here virtuous dames with busy hand,
 untiring do what should be done,
and sons and fathers till the land,
 and to each manly duty run.

the winsome maids with willing hearts,
 in youthful beauty all aglow,
right cheerfully perform their parts
 where duty's voice may bid them go.

oh, may their graceful figures long
 their youthful energy retain,
and may they meet no heartless wrong,
 to fill their gentle souls with pain.

as yet there is no village bell,
 save that which rings the call to school,
where festive youth drink at the well
 which flows from knowledge' sparkling pool.

and yet, whene'er the sabbath comes,
 or week night held for praise and prayer,
no need for signal bells and drums,
 each knows the time, and he is there.

there is the daughter, there the son,
 to kneel in humble prayer to god,
and those whose race is well-nigh run,
 who humbly kiss the chast'ning rod.

oh, blest content, and lowly life
 that blunts ambition's biting sting
unknown to thee the bitter strife,
 which proud refinements often bring.

is there room for the poet, fair canada's sons.
to live his strange life, and to warble his songs,
to follow each current of thought as it runs,
and to sing of your victories, glories and wrongs?

is there room for the poet, ye senators grave?
ye orators, statesmen and law-makers, say;
may he of the calling so gentle e'er crave
your patronage, and of your kindness a ray?

ye toilers in cities, ye workers in fields,
who handle the hammer, the pen or the plow,
can the poet implicitly trust, as he yields
his heart, and his hopes, and his name to you now?

wilt thou pardon his follies, forgive him his faults
in manners, in habits, in distance and time?
for when on his charger, pegasus, he vaults,
he rises o'er reason's safe, temperate clime.

he will sing of his country, his people and thine,
exalt, if you aid him, your honor and fame.
your sympathy, acting like purest of wine,
will urge him to joyously sing of your name.

his case is peculiar, stern fate has been hard,
his body unfitted for labours of men,
his mind, with the sensitive make of the bard,
unfitted for aught, but the work of the pen.

he singeth, but yet he must live, as he sings;
he hath wants of the earth, that must be supplied;
and tho' 'tis an off'ring most humble he brings,
he hopes that your favors will not be denied.

our country is young, let us early instil
deep into the minds of the youthful and fair,
the greatness of virtue, uprightness and will,
and the poet will help you to 'stablish them there.

be it his to proclaim, e'en tho' rudely, in measure,
the rights of his country, her honour, renown;
to sing of whatever his people may treasure,
in court or in camp, in the country or town.

'tis not with glad fruition crown'd,
we always feel our greatest joy;
for pleasure often dwells around
the heart that hopes, and knows no cloy.

we wait, we watch, we think, we plan
to catch the pleasure ere it flies,
but when 'tis caught, for which we ran,
it often droops, perchance, it dies.

in truth the non-possession oft'
creates the chief, the only charm,
of that, which, once obtain'd, is scoff'd,
and oft' receiv'd with vex'd alarm.

the mind of man is strange and deep,
deceiving others and himself;
its wiles would make an angel weep,
in strife for praise, for power and pelf.

he strives continually to bend
those qualities, with wondrous skill,
to meet in one, which never blend.

david's lamentation over saul and jonathan.

the beauty of israel is slain on thy mountains,
the mighty are low, and how great is their fall,
but tell not our grief in gath, by the fountains,
and publish it not within askelon's wall,
lest the philistines' daughters shall mock at our
sorrow,
and triumph in gladness o'er us in our pain,
and sound all their timbrels and harps on the morrow,
while here we are sore, in lamenting our slain.

oh! gilboa's mountains, from now and forever,
let moisture, which falleth as rain, or as dew,
come down on thy parch'd, burning summits, oh, never,
for the shield of the mighty is cast upon you.
from the blood of the slain, from the fat of the
highest,
the bow of fair jonathan never did quail,
and the sword of his father, in danger the highest,
went forth to brave deeds, like the sweep of the gale.

o saul thou anointed! and jonathan, brother!
in life ye were pleasant and lovely to see;
and still in your death ye are lovely together,
tho' great is my grief, and my sorrow, for thee.
ye were swifter than eagles, ye heaven anointed,
and stronger than lions, thou glorious pair,
bur sad was the day, that jehovah appointed,
to humble your strength, and your bravery, there.

oh, weep o'er the fallen, fair israel's daughters!
he cloth'd you in scarlet, and deck'd you with gold,
then shed ye your tears, until their sad waters
shall moisten the tomb, where now he is cold;
i'm sad for thee, jonathan, more than my brother,
so kindly and gentle, so faithful and free,
i lov'd thee, as never i shall love another,
and thou hadst a wonderful love unto me.

the mighty have fallen, their weapons have perish'd!
and, slain in high places, so low lies the brave;
no more i shall gaze on the face that i cherish'd.

the diamond and the pebble.

why value ye the diamond, and
the pearl from ceylon's balmy shore,
when stones unnumber'd strew the land,
and in the sea are millions more?
why treasure ye each silver bar,
and watch, with argus eye, your gold,
when lead and iron, near and far,
are strewn beneath the rocks and mould.

ye prize those shining gems, because
their sparkling beauty cheers the eye,
and, by the force of nature's laws,
they never in profusion lie.
could we, aladdin like, descend
into a place where diamonds grow,
our minds would then most surely tend
to value diamonds very low.

the emerald's or diamond's shine,
is valued not for that alone,
but for its absence in the mine,
where thousands lie, of common stone.
and thus, within the world of thought,
the pebble and the lead abound,
but real pearls are seldom brought,
and gold or silver rarely found.

we all have thoughts, we speak them, too,
the world is fill'd with words of men,
but still is priz'd the precious hue,
of golden thoughts from tongue or pen;
and he who digs and brings to light
a lovely thought, a pearly gem,
'twill surely shine with lustre bright,
for men, to cheer and better them.

will lead us onward, by degrees,

with sparkling gems of richest hue.

a radiance, that none divine,
save those, who early leave their beds,
when glist'ning dew-drops briefly shine.

just ere the rising sunbeams play,

but when the blessed, welcome beams,
light up, and cheer, and warm the earth,
all things awaken from their dreams,
to celebrate creation's birth.

the very fields are filled with life,
with hum of bee, and insect throng;
the woods are vocal, with the strife
of friendly rivalry, in song.
but 'tis the sabbath morn, and now
are heard no sounds of industry,

which might not shame an angel's wings.

which none may whisper, none may tell,
a secret thing in ev'ry bower,
which ev'ry tenant hideth well.

there is a tale of joy and woe,
round ev'ry hearth, in ev'ry land,

the pine tree.

the wind last night was wild and strong,
 it shriek'd, it whistl'd and it roar'd,
and went with whirl and swoop along,
 'mid falling trees and crashing board.

the timbers creak'd, the rafters sway'd,
 and e'en some roofs, upheav'd and torn,
came crashing to the earth, and laid
 before the view, upon the morn.

the air seem'd like some monstrous thing,
 by its uncurbed passion held;
like dreadful dragon on the wing,
 so horribly it scream'd and yell'd.

now venting a triumphant shout,
 and ever and anon a groan,
like fiend from prison lately out,
 or like unhappy chain'd one's moan.

there was a lofty pine i knew;
 each morn and eve i passed it by;
to such a lofty height it grew,
 it caught at once each passing eye.

it stood alone, and proudly stood,
 with straight, and clean, and lofty stem;
all other trees it seemed to view,
 as though it scorn'd to live with them.

full many a winter's snow had whirl'd
 about its base, and settl'd there,
and many an autumn mist had curl'd
 about its head, so high in air.

full many a blast had spent, in vain,
 its force, for, ever like a rock,
it stood each persevering strain,
 and long defied the tempest's shock.

but yesternight it crashing fell,
 and now, this morn, i see it lie.
i knew the brave old tree so well,
 a tear almost bedims my eye.

but brave old trees, like brave old men,
 must feel at last the fatal stroke,
that dashest them to earth again,
 tho' lofty pine, or mighty oak.

i'll miss, old tree, thy lofty stem
 outlin'd against the distant sky,
but 'tis no gain to fret for them--
 for men, or trees, that fall and die.

autumn.

the grass is wet with heavy dew,
the leaves have changed their bright green hue,
 to brighter red, or golden;
the morning sun shines with a glow,
as bright and pure as long ago,
 in time ye left the olden.

one tree is cloth'd with scarlet dress,
and one, with brown leaf'd loveliness,
 delights the eye that gazes;
while others varied tints display,
but all, in beauteous array,
 delight us, and amaze us.

we see the trees in beauty clad,
but still that beauty makes us sad,
 e'en while we may admire,
for death has caus'd that sudden bloom
stern death, the tenant of the tomb,
 or funereal pyre.

the ruthless, bitter, biting air
hath dried the life which flourish'd there,
 throughout the warmer seasons;
the nourishment hath ceas'd to flow
through veins, where once it us'd to go--
 hath ceas'd for diff'rent reasons.

and soon the leaves will strew the ground,
and whirl with rustling ardor round,
 or lie in heaps together,
their hues of red, of brown, of gold,
will blacken, as they change to mould
 by action of the weather.

but leaves will grow where once they grew,
will bud, and bloom, and perish too,
 the same as all the others,
as we through youth, and joy, and grief,
must find at last a sure relief,
 as did our many brothers.

like in the leaf, no life-blood flows,
when frosts of death the fountain close,
 from which it flow'd, to nourish.
and like the leaf, another spring
around us shall her gladness fling;
 another life shall flourish.

our bodies turn to dust or mould.
as lifeless as the rocks, and cold,
 but life's fair tree is living.
and fadeless green leaves we shall be,
because the fountain of that tree
 eternal life is giving.

canada.

come now, my muse, do thou inspire my pen,
to sing, with worthy strain, my country's praise,
but not to hide the faults within my ken,
by tricks of art, or studied, verbal maze,
to play on him who reads with careless gaze,
to whom each thought upon a printed page.
is gospel truth, nor e'er with wile betrays;
from this, oh, steer me clear, nor let the rage
of prejudic'd and narrow minds, my thoughts engage.

oh, canada! the land where first i saw
the blue of heav'n, and bursting light of day,
where breezes warm and mild, and breezes raw,
first o'er my boyhood's eager face did play,
as o'er the hills i stepp'd my joyful way.
held by a loving hand, i went along
thro' shelter'd wood, or by some shaded bay,
and ever, as i went, i sang a song,
with sylvan joy, amid a sylvan throng.

for birds and bees, and e'en the flowers, did sing
their cheerful songs, with voices pure and sweet;
their notes were silent, yet those notes did bring
a soothing balm, amid a calm retreat.
protected from the sun's relentless heat.
oh, wearied men, could ye but once divine
the healing pow'r of some lone country seat,
you would not strive to drown your care in wine,
or vainly seek relief, in any lustful line.

but this is not a moralizing lay,
of canada i sing, and her alone,
her varied progress, every passing day,
her faults, for which, in time, she must atone,
by nature's law, in every clime and zone,
then what are the peculiar, common claims,
our country has with nations larger grown,
and the superior things she classes as her own.

first let us take her climate; who will not
say she is favour'd there o'er other lands?
the winter's cold, indeed, and summer's hot,
but in a robust health the native stands,
so keen to work with brain, or use his hands.
where, let me ask, between the distant poles
is there a clime so mod'rate in demands,
where men are not compell'd to live like moles,
nor drop with heat on burning, barren, sandy knolls.

a hardy, energetic, toilsome race,
is raised within this favourable clime,
in physical and mental power apace
with those of any land, and any time,
save in the golden age, that age of thought sublime;
but, what i mean is this: that her own men
do act their parts, they reason or they rhyme
within their bounds, with keen, far-reaching ken,
for those who late have left the axe to wield the pen.

yes, left the axe, whose skilful, cleaving stroke
hew'd out a home from 'mid the forest wild,
where grew the maple and the lofty oak,
where liv'd the dusky colour'd forest child,
so sternly fierce in war, in peace so mild;
yes, here the settler met with nature's force;
quite unsubdued, she look'd around and smil'd,
and seem'd to view with scorn the white man's course
of labour slow, but yet of wealth the only source.

but still the patient white man plodded on,
he swung his axe, and drove his horned team;
at times he felt despair, but soon 'twas gone,
and gladsome rays of hope would brightly gleam
to cheer his path, like light on darken'd stream.
some saw their hopes fulfill'd, some sank to rest
amid their toil, but, sinking, saw the beam
of brighter days, to make their children blest.
and give a rich reward to ev'ry earnest guest.

these latter gaz'd on fertile fields, and saw,
the waving grain, where stood the forest tree,
where prowl'd the bear; or wolf, with hungry maw,
howl'd in the settlers' ears so dismally,
that children crouch'd near to their mother's knee.
they saw, instead of plain, bark-roof'd abode,
a mansion wide, the scene of youthful glee,
and happy age, now resting on his road,
to pay the debt, his sinning kind so long hath ow'd.

the organ or piano sounds its tone,
where late in darkness cried the whip-poor-will,
or gloomy owl's to whoo! to whoo! alone,
came from the glen, or darkly wooded hill,--
these sounds, untaught, and unimprov'd in skill.
all round, where'er they look, they see a change,
by rolling lake, by river, mount or rill;
wherever feet may walk, or eyes may range,
there is a transformation pleasing, new and strange.

schools, churches, built in costly, solid style,
proclaim the fact that here a higher life
is liv'd than that of seeking all the while
for wealth, and pow'r, amid ignoble strife,
degrading unto husband, son or wife.
the scholar's light, and blest religion's smile
ennobles, soothes and lends a joy to life--
a pow'r, which counteracts the trickster's wile
and blunts the edge of slander undeserv'd and vile.

from where the fierce atlantic waters rage,
unto the mild pacific's fertile shore,
small villages to cities rise and wage
a steady war; but not a war of gore--
a friendly rivalry exists, no more,
save in the far north-west, where savage clan
ungrateful rise, and make a serious sore,
whose pains increas'd, as eastward far it ran,
and plac'd the british race beneath the frenchman's ban.

but quickly, let us hope, the time may come,
when peacefully the british flag shall wave,
and when the rebels' terrorizing drum
shall be as still as kiel's rebel grave,
o'er the wide land, whose sides two oceans lave;
when demagogues of party shall retire,
or curb their selfish zeal, their land to save
from factious feuds and savage rebel fire.
and all that tends to raise the patriot's scorn and ire.

from ocean unto ocean runs a band,
a double band of hard and gleaming steel;
it binds in one this fertile, mighty land,
in bonds which all should recognize and feel,
if anxious to promote their country's weal.
a bond which nature's sympathetic law
should fasten on our hearts with solid seal,
which factious feuds should ne'er asunder draw,
nor wily traitors cut, by selfish treason's saw.

the strange, stupendous, magic power of steam,
in works, is great as fam'd aladdin's ring,
it carries men o'er miles of land and stream,
and maketh loom and forge, with labour sing,
and o'er the land, a busy air doth fling.
that fluid, too, that none can well define,
in active life hath wrought a wondrous thing.
it speeds our words with lightning flash or sign,
and maketh glorious light from midnight's darkness
shine.

then to our country's future we may gaze
with gladden'd eyes, and hearts with hope aglow,
that our young country still its head will raise,
and stand 'mid nations, in the foremost row,
high honour'd there, and honour'd not for show--
for solid worth, and lasting pow'r and fame
will be her portion, if her footsteps go
in duty's path, and if the ruddy flame
of honor shines within, and keeps away all shame.

youthful fancies.

 the morning of a gladsome day in spring
 had scarce its freshness brought to weary men,
 when, o'er the meadows wet, a boy did sing,
 and whistled o'er a tune, and carroll'd-it, again,
 in youthful happiness unconscious then
 of aught which time might bring, of pain or woe,
 but careless, pitching stones in bog or fen,
 it seem'd as if he buried there, also,
all worldly cares, so blithely did he onward go.

 and yet he was no careless, heedless boy,
 who thought but of the present time alone.
 of future years he thought, but with such joy,
 his thoughts but pleasure gave, nor caused a groan
 from out the breast that claim'd them as its own;
 his thoughts were of the future, fair and bright,
 and fresh from his unburden'd heart, alone,
 untarnish'd by the hard and glaring light,
by which he yet might see with such a diff'rent sight.

 a picture of the blissful future, he
 had gaily painted in his youthful mind,
 and thought no color there too bright to be
 an image of his share from fortune kind,
 which she, in future years, would give so free,
 to him, the lucky sailor on life's sea.
 he thought of honor, happiness and fame,
 as he went gaily o'er the dewy lea,
 and to his mind no thought of failure came,
to win a prize of worth, in life's tremendous game.

 he heard his parents, brothers, sisters, all,
 with pride and fondness, speak his honor'd name,
 and listen'd, while a nation's mighty call
 invited him to honor and to fame,
 and crowds his praises shout, with loud acclaim;
 he saw in wealthy town his mansion wide,
 and in the country view'd his fields, the same,
 until, in rapture, he had almost cried,
"in happiness and wealth all others are outvied."


 he saw a lovely maiden by his side,
 who soon with him his favor'd lot would share,
 he saw her upward glance of joy and pride,
 as to his eyes she rais'd her face so fair,
 so proudly glad that he, her lord, was there.
 and all unconscious of her own sweet grace,
 but, confident in his protecting care,
 she gave him first within her mind the place,
and raised him high above all others of his race.

 and now, how joyful rings the marriage bell,
 upon the brightest morn in his career.
 he proudly hears the mighty organ swell,
 while orange buds, and bridal robes, appear,
 and people stop, the merry notes to hear.
 and now the organ peals its parting strain,
 and, issuing forth, they hear a stirring cheer,
 while, crowds surround the stately marriage train,
to cheer him and his bride, and cheer them once again.

 these are the thoughts that fill his boyish mind,
 and agitate and fire his youthful breast,
 oh, why should fortune oft' be so unkind,
 and real life appear in sombre colors drest,
 and dash to earth bright hopes, and give so much unrest?
 oh, why should boyish hopes, and maiden's dreams
 fail, sadly fail, to stand the crucial test?
 say, why should all the brightness of man's schemes
full often fade away, like earth's forgotten themes?

 why do you ask, o sad inquirer? how
 can things like that be known to mortal ken?
 suffice it, that it suits the mortal now,
 and leads our thoughts to the eternal then,
 when darkness shall be light, to ransom'd men,
 when dreams of bliss, with glad fruition crown'd,
 and happiness, untold by prophet's pen,
 shall fill the hearts of those who sought and found
that peace, which lighted up, and cheer'd life's weary
round.

the man must hunt the deer, without

the ice which late had spann'd for miles

to miss ----

youth is the time when all is bright;
 the mind is free from care;
no thoughts of aught, save present joys,
 can find an entrance there.

and, if a thought of future years
 steal o'er the careless mind,
that thought speaks of a happier time
 when years are left behind.

but when the years of youth have fled,
 and life is fill'd with pain,
we think full oft of vanish'd years,
 and wish them back again.

and oft this wish will soothe our pain,
 and oft allay our woe,
oh, sweet to us is mem'ry then,
 when we think of long ago.

may thou live on till youth has pass'd,
 and feel but little pain,
and may thou, in a blest old age,
 live o'er your youth again.

to a friend.

with kindly thoughts full oft we've met,
and bow'd at friendship's sacred shrine;
oh, may we ne'er those thoughts forget,
but may they still our hearts entwine.

which prompt the words of friendly tongue,
may i not fail to think of thee,
nor you to think of t. f. young.

with kindly heart these lines i trace,
to tell you of a kindly wish,
which i upon this page would place.

it is that thou thro' future years
may meet with very much of joy,
and just a little grief, because
continued happiness will cloy.

and when, in future years, you read
what i to you just now have sung,
let others praise or blame, do thou
think pleasantly of t. f. young.

to ----

these lines, which on this leaf i write,
i trace with friendly thoughts of thee,
and hope, when o'er this page you glance,
you'll think a kindly thought of me.

and why should i this tribute ask?
why crave from you this humble boon?
because i knew you through life's morn,
and hope to know you in its noon.

because the path of life we trod,
with youthful hearts so free from pain,
when both together went to school,
and wander'd gaily home again.

this, then, is why i ask of you,
as on this little page you look,
to think of me, with other friends,
whose names are written in your book.

in years to come, when looking o'er
 these lines i've penn'd for thee,
i trust that thou shalt ne'er have cause
 to think unkind of me.

and if you have, let memory
 try hard to blunt the dart,
and tho' i may deserve the blame,
 let kindness soothe the smart.

the youthful joys of vanish'd years,
 the joys e'en now we share,
have something of a sacred bliss,
 which time can not impair.

for when the years of youth have gone,
 its joys and hopes have flown,
the mem'ry clings with fond embrace--
 those joys are still our own.

then, as i write these words for you,--
 this earnest wish i pen:
that you may think but pleasant thoughts--
 when life's liv'd o'er again.

may nought of sorrow, or of woe,
 invade to wound or pain,
and may the joys that we have shar'd
 be bright in mem'ry's train.


to miss ----

in tracing here these lines, my friend,
 which spring from friendly heart,
i here record an earnest wish,
 for thee, before we part:

may health and happiness serene,
 long, long with thee abide,
may youthful joys no sorrow bring,
 nor future woes betide.

and when thy youthful beauty leaves,
 and youthful thoughts thy breast,
may thou in calm old age still live,
 in happiness and rest.

go, little girl, your course pursue,
 on life's rough ocean safely glide,
may want nor woe e'er visit you,
 nor any other ills betide.

 for soon, alas, they will be gone,
strive hard for learning, zeal and truth,
 for ev'ry soul must fight alone.


to a friend.

within this little book of thine,
 are thoughts of many a friendly mind,
express'd in words, on which you'll gaze
 in after years, with feelings kind.

and while you're scanning o'er each page,
 these lines i write, perchance you'll see,
and tho' they're penn'd by careless hand,
 you'll know that they are penn'd by me.

perhaps you'll think of school-days then,
 of happy school-days, long since past,
when you and i, in careless youth,
 thought that those days would always last.

the land of poetry and mirth,
of orators and statesmen, too,
to one more genial, ne'er gave birth,
than when, gay moore, it brought forth you.

the land of goldsmith, wolfe and burke,
may well, with gladness, sound thy name,
and honor thee, whose life and work
produc'd a bright and joyous flame.

thy lively genius, sparkling, free,
emitted rays, which sparkle yet,
and gladden hearts across the sea,
when tears of pain their eyelids wet.

mild goldsmith sang with taste, and well,
and so did wolfe, his plaintive ode,
but thou, alone, possess'd the spell,
that served to ease thy country's load.

o'connell work'd with wondrous skill,
with silv'ry tongue, and prudent head,
with patriotic heart and will,
to ease oppression's crushing tread.

he did remove th' oppressor's weight,
or made it rest more lightly there,
but still there crowded in the gate
the ills of life we all must share.

great burke, with comprehensive mind,
pour'd forth his thoughts, too lofty far,
to glad his humble, simple kind,
who could not reach the lowest bar.

but thou brought forth thy tuneful lyre,
and swept it with a skilful hand,
and hearts, with joy and hope afire,
arose to bless thee, thro' the land.

thy songs of love, religion, fame,
resounded from each hill and dale,
and fann'd the patriotic flame,
in beautiful avoca's vale.

they reach'd us here, we have them now,
and treasure them, both rich and poor;
and here's a green wreath for thy brow,
of irish shamrocks, thomas moore.

in fadeless verdure may it stay,
and long thy gifted head entwine,
for time will mark full many a day,
till head and heart shall live, like thine.


robert burns.

one hundred years have come and gone,
since thy brave spirit came to earth,
since scotland saw thy genius dawn,
and had the joy to give thee birth.

there was no proud and brilliant throng,
to celebrate thine advent here,
and but the humble heard the song,
which first proclaim'd a poet near.

but genius will assert its right
to speak a word, or chant a lay,
and thou, with independent might,
asserted it from day to day.

no fawning, sycophantic whine,
marr'd the clear note thy spirit blew,
thy stirring words, thy gift divine,
were to thyself and country true.

tho' heir to naught of wealth, or land,
thy soaring mind, with fancy fir'd,
saw, in creation's lavish hand,
the gifts display'd, thy soul desir'd.

the field, the forest and the hill
supplied thee with exhaustless wealth,
the singing birds, and flowing rill,
unto thy soul gave food and health.

an honest man thou lov'd, and thou
wert honest to thy bosom's core,
as harden'd hand, and sweated brow,
a true, tho' silent witness bore.

no empty theorizer, thou,
thy words said what thyself would do,
thou ne'er would make thy spirit bow,
that worldly honors might accrue.

torn by temptations, strange and wild--
hard-hearted critics laugh to scorn
the fate of the "poetic child,"
in rugged, bonnie scotland born.

but let them laugh, they laugh in vain.
for they, or we, who know in part,
can never gauge the mighty strain,
that burst the genial poet's heart.

it is enough for us to know
the songs he sang for scotland's sake,
which winds of time can never blow
into oblivion's silent lake.

o burns! thy life was sad, we know,
thy sensitive and fertile mind
had to withstand full many a blow,
dealt by the ignorant and blind.

but let us do thee justice here,
tho' distant from thy native shore,
for all thy faults repress the sneer,
and thy great qualities explore.

in canada, where all are free,
and none can e'er be call'd a slave,
let scotia's sons remember thee,
and weave a garland for thy grave.

in fancy, let them grace thy brows
with wreathes of fadeless asphodel,
and let them yearly plight their vows
unto the bard they love so well.


byron.

while genius endows the sons of men
with eloquence, or with poetic pen,
it leaves them still the frailties of our frame,
it does not curb, but fans th' unrighteous flame.
it gives a wider, nobler range of thought,
but such advantage, oft, is dearly bought.
man's lower nature troubles scarce the low,
but, like a fiend, at natures high doth go.
of such a nature, now, these lines shall tell,
who wrote full many a line, and wrote them well.
byron, the noble, sensitive and high,
whose bosom hath not heav'd for thee a sigh?
whose breast hath not full often given room
to mournful thoughts, for thy untimely doom?
thy genius soar'd to regions bright and fair,
and thou, such times, were with thy genius there.
and then thy lofty mind, 'neath passion's sway,
left its high throne, and wander'd far astray.
'twas strange and sad, that one so richly bless'd,
should find within the world, so much unrest;
but we can in thy life and nature see
the means, to some extent, that fell'd the tree.
thy shining youth, men much too freely prais'd,
and then the cry of blame, too loudly rais'd.
the fickle crowd, thy person loudly curs'd,
and then thou fled, and dar'd them do their worst.
unfortunate in love, thy youthful heart
was pain'd, and likewise with the burning smart
thy vanity receiv'd from critic's pen,
which often makes sarcastic, stronger men.
let us be fair with thee, thy fate deplore,
and grieve thy youthful death, if nothing more.
let us in mercy judge, for thus we can,
e'en with thy faults, thou wert a noble man.


memories of schooldays.

there are mem'ries glad of the old school-house,
 which throng around me still;
and voices spoke in my youthful days,
 my ears with music fill.

those youthful voices i seem to hear,
 with their gladsome, joyous tone,
and joy and hope they bring to me,
 when i am all alone.

i think of the joys of that time long past,
 of its boyish hopes and fears,
and 'tis partly joy, and partly pain,
 that wets my eyes with tears.

for 'tis joy i feel, when i seem to stand,
 where i stood long years ago,
and when i think that cannot be,
 my heart is fill'd with woe.

my old school mates are scatter'd far,
 and some are with the dead,
and my old class mates have wander'd, too,
 to seek for fame, or bread.

and those who still are near my home,
 and whom i often see,
have come to manhood's grave estate;
 they're boys no more to me.

and tho' we meet in converse yet,
 and each one's thoughts enjoy,
our thoughts and words are not so free,
 as when, each was a boy.

for the spring of life is gone for us,
 with all its bursting bloom,
and manhood's thoughts, and joys, and cares,
 are now within its room.

but the mem'ry of our bright school days,
 will last through ev'ry strain,
and time will brighten ev'ry joy,
 and darken ev'ry pain.

the rippling of our childhood's laugh,
 will roll adown the years,
and time will blunt, each day we live,
 the mem'ry of our tears.

our boyhood's hopes, and boyhood's dreams,
 and aspirations high,
will doubtless never be fulfill'd,
 until the day we die.

but still we'll cherish in our hearts,
 and live those days again,
when awkardly we read our books,
 or trembling held the pen.

how few there are who know the pure delight,
 the chaste influence, and the solace sweet,
of walking forth to see the glorious sight,
 when nature rises, with respect, to greet
the lord of day on his majestic seat,
 like some great personage of high degree,
who cometh forth his subjects all to meet,
 like him, but yet more glorious far than he,
 he comes with splendor bright, to shed o'er land and
sea.

with stately, slow and solemn march he comes,
 and gradually pours forth his brilliant rays,
unheralded by sounding brass or drums,
 his blazing glory on our planet plays,
and sendeth healing light thro' darken'd ways.
 his undimm'd splendor maketh mortals quail,
and e'en, at times, it fiercely strikes and slays;
 but then it brighteneth the cheek so pale,
 revives the plant, and loosens every nail
 that fastens sorrow to the heart, within this vale.

but 'tis the morning glory of the sun,
 i would request you now to view with me,
'twill cheer that smitten heart, thou grieved one,
 and lighter make your load of misery,
 when you can hear and see all nature's glee.
come friend arise, determin'd, drowse no more,
 but stroll away to yonder hill with me;
and all the landscape round we shall explore,
all nature slumbers now; its sleep will soon be o'er.

the stillness now is strange, oppressive, grand,
 the hush of death is now o'er all the earth,
as if it slept by power of genius's hand,
 but soon the spell shall break, and songs and mirth,
 and light, shall all proclaim the morning's birth.
e'en now behold the sun's advancing gleams,
 the heralds of his coming, but the dearth
of words forbid my telling how the streams,
and dewy grass are glinting, sparkling in the beams.

or of the change, so steady and so sure,
 that creeps upon creation all around,
unwaken'd yet from slumbers bright and pure,
 by atmospheric change, or earthly sound,
 such as at times awakes with sudden bound.

there comes a change o'er earth, and trees, and sky,
 and all creation's work wherever found,
save man, for he, with unawaken'd eye,
in dozing, slothful ease, will yet for hours lie.

the grandest artificial sights will pall
 upon the taste, and oft repeated, tire,
but each succeeding morn, the monarch sol
 bedecks the world with fresh and vig'rous fire,
that cheers the fainting heart and sootheth ire.
 each morn, the gazer seeth something new,
and even what he saw will never tire,
 for in an aspect clear and fresh, the view
 will gladden still your eyes, tho' oft it's gladden'd
you.

by slow degrees the heralds make their way,
 until, at last, old sol himself appears,
to reign supreme thro' all the blessed day,
 as he hath reign'd for many thousand years
 o'er joy and woe, bright smiles and bitter tears.
the very air is now astir with life,
 and all around, unto our eyes and ears
come evidences of a kindly strife,
for fields, and air, and trees with bustling now are
rife.

all animated nature seems to vie
 each with the other, in their energy
of preparation for the day's supply
 of work or play, or whate'er else may be
 prompted for them to do instinctively.
the grass is fill'd with buzzing insect throngs,
 there's music in the air, and every tree
is vocal with the wild-bird's gladsome songs,
songs unrestrain'd by care or memory of wrongs.

a million tiny drops of crystal dew,
 in shining splendor make the meadows fair;
the leaves upon the trees are greener, too,
 as, swaying in the gentle morning air,
 they are again prepar'd to stand the glare
of sol's meridian heat, and give their shade
 to myriads of feather'd songsters there.
our trip to see the sun arise is made,
 let us retrace our steps, and bravely share
 our portion of life's grief, anxiety and care.
