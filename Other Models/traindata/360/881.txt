the philosophy of a sauce, when understood, enables even an untrained
cook to make a great variety of every day sauces from materials
usually found in every household; to have them uniform, however,
flavorings must be correctly blended, and measurements must be rigidly
observed. two level tablespoonfuls of butter or other fat, two level
tablespoonfuls of flour, must be used to each half pint of liquid. if
the yolks of eggs are added, omit one tablespoonful of flour or the
sauce will be too thick. tomato sauce should be flavored with onion, a
little mace, and a suspicion of curry. brown sauce may be simply
seasoned with salt and pepper, flavored and colored with kitchen
bouquet. spanish sauce should also be flavored with mushrooms, or if
you can afford it, a truffle, a little chopped ham, a tablespoonful of
chives, shallot and garlic. water sauce, drawn butter and simple sauce
hollandaise, when they are served with fish, must be flavored with a
dash of tarragon vinegar, salt and pepper.

cooking of eggs


any single food containing all the elements necessary to supply the
requirements of the body is called a complete or typical food. milk
and eggs are frequently so called, because they sustain the young
animals of their kind during a period of rapid growth. nevertheless,
neither of these foods forms a perfect diet for the human adult. both
are highly nutritious, but incomplete.

served with bread or rice, they form an admirable meal and one that is
nutritious and easily digested. the white of eggs, almost pure
albumin, is nutritious, and, when cooked in water at 170 degrees
fahrenheit, requires less time for perfect digestion than a raw egg.
the white of a hard-boiled egg is tough and quite insoluble. the yolk,
however, if the boiling has been done carefully for twenty minutes, is
mealy and easily digested. fried eggs, no matter what fat is used, are
hard, tough and insoluble. the yolk of an egg cooks at a lower
temperature than the white, and for this reason an egg should not be
boiled unless the yolk alone is to be used.

ten eggs are supposed to weigh a pound, and, unless they are unusually
large or small, this is quite correct.

eggs contain from 72 to 84 per cent. of water, about 12 to 14 per
cent. of albuminoids. the yolk is quite rich in fat; the white
deficient. they also contain mineral matter and extractives.

to ascertain the freshness of an egg without breaking it, hold your
hand around the egg toward a bright light or the sun and look through
it. if the yolk appears quite round and the white clear, it is fresh.
or, if you put it in a bucket of water and it falls on its side, it is
fresh. if it sort of topples in the water, standing on its end, it is
fairly fresh, but, if it floats, beware of it. the shell of a fresh
egg looks dull and porous. as it begins to age, the shell takes on a
shiny appearance. if an egg is kept any length of time, a portion of
its water evaporates, which leaves a space in the shell, and the egg
will "rattle." an egg that rattles may be perfectly good, and still
not absolutely fresh.


to preserve eggs

to preserve eggs it is only necessary to close the pores of the
shells. this may be done by dipping them in melted paraffine, or
packing them in salt, small ends down; or pack them in a keg and cover
them with brine; or pack them in a keg, small ends down and cover them
with lime water; this not only protects them from the air, but acts as
a germicide.

eggs should not be packed for winter use later than the middle of may
or earlier than the first of april. where large quantities of the
yolks are used, the whites may be evaporated and kept in glass bottles
or jars. spread them out on a stoneware or granite plate and allow
them to evaporate at the mouth of a cool oven. when the mixture is
perfectly dry, put it away. this powder is capable of taking up the
same amount of water that has been evaporated from it, and may then be
used the same as fresh whites.


eggs and crumbing

to do this successfully one must prepare a mixture, and not use the
egg alone. if an egg mixture or a croquette is dipped in beaten egg
and rolled in cracker crumbs and dropped into fat, it always has a
greasy covering. this is the wrong way. to do it successfully and have
the articles handsome, beat the egg until well mixed, add a
teaspoonful of olive oil, a tablespoonful of water and a dash of
pepper. dip the articles into this mixture, and then drop them on
quite a thick bed of either sifted dry bread crumbs or soft white
bread crumbs.

i prefer sifted dry bread crumbs for croquettes, and soft white crumbs
for lobster cutlets and deviled crabs.


shirred eggs

cover the bottoms of individual dishes with a little butter and a few
fresh bread crumbs; drop into each dish two fresh eggs; stand this
dish in a pan of hot water and cook in the oven until the whites are
"set." put a tiny bit of butter in the middle of each, and a dusting
of salt and pepper.


eggs mexicana

dash of red pepper and a half pint of tomatoes; the tomatoes should be
in rather solid pieces. add a seasoning of pepper and salt. let this
cook slowly while you shir the desired quantity of eggs. when the eggs
are ready to serve, put two tablespoonfuls of this sauce at each side
of the dish, and send at once to the table.


eggs on a plate

rub the bottom of a baking dish with butter. dust it lightly with salt
and pepper. break in as many fresh eggs as required. stand the dish in

minutes. lift them from the water, put them into a large bowl, cover
with boiling water, and send at once to the table. the whites will be
coagulated, but should be soft and creamy, while the yolks will be
perfectly cooked. if you should add six eggs to this volume of water,
lengthen the time of standing. a single egg, dropped into a quart of
water, must stand five minutes.

saucepan, add the onions, cut into _very thin_ slices; shake until the
onions are soft, but not brown, then dust over the flour, mix, and add
the milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. stir carefully until this reaches
boiling point, then stand it on the back part of the stove where it
will keep hot for at least ten minutes. beat the yolks of the eggs
until very creamy, then stir them into the sauce, take from the fire,
and fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs. turn into a baking
dish or casserole and bake in a hot oven fifteen minutes; serve at
once.


to poach eggs

use a shallow frying pan partly filled with boiling water. the eggs
must be perfectly fresh. the white of an egg is held in a membrane
which seems to lose its tenacity after the egg is three days old. such
an egg, when dropped into boiling water, spreads out; that is, it does
not retain its shape. when ready to poach eggs, take the required
number to the stove. the water must be boiling hot, but not actually
bubbling. break an egg into a saucer, slide it quickly into the water,
and then another and another. pull the pan to the side of the stove,
where the water cannot possibly boil. with a tablespoon, baste the
water over the yolks of the eggs, if they happen to be exposed. they
must be entirely covered with a thin veil of the white. have ready the
desired quantity of toast on a heated platter, lift each egg with a
slice or skimmer, trim off the ragged edges and slide them at once on
the toast. dust with salt and pepper, baste with melted butter, and
send to the table.

madeira may be substituted for the brandy.




omelets


a plain french omelet is, perhaps, one of the most difficult of all
things to make; that is, it is the most difficult to have well made in
the ordinary private house. failures come from beating the eggs until
they are too light, or having the butter too hot, or cooking the
omelet too long before serving.

in large families, where it is necessary to use a dozen eggs, two
omelets will be better than one. a six-egg omelet is quite easily
handled. do not use milk; it toughens the eggs and gives an unpleasant
flavor to the omelet. an "omelet pan," a shallow frying pan, should be
kept especially for omelets. each time it is used rub until dry, but
do not wash. dust it with salt and rub it with brown paper until
perfectly clean.

to make an omelet: first, put a tablespoonful of butter in the middle
of the pan. let it heat slowly. break the eggs in a bowl, add a
tablespoonful of water to each egg and give twelve good, vigorous
beats. to each six eggs allow a saltspoonful of pepper, and, if you
like, a tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley. take the eggs, a
limber knife and the salt to the stove. draw the pan over the hottest
part of the fire, turn in the eggs, and dust over a half teaspoonful
of salt. shake the pan so that the omelet moves and folds itself over
each time you draw the pan towards you. lift the edge of the omelet,
allowing the thin, uncooked portion of the egg to run underneath.
shake again, until the omelet is "set." have ready heated a platter,
fold over the omelet and turn it out. garnish with parsley, and send
to the table.

if one can make a plain french omelet, it may be converted into many,
many kinds.


omelet with asparagus tips

make a plain omelet from six eggs, have ready a half pint of cream
sauce, and either a can or a bundle of cooked asparagus. cut off the
tips, preserving the lower portions for another dish. when the omelet
is turned onto the heated platter, put the asparagus tips at the ends,
cover them with cream sauce, pour the rest of the cream sauce in the
platter, not over the omelet.


omelet with green peas

make a six-egg omelet. have ready one pint of cooked peas, or a can of
peas, seasoned with salt, pepper and butter. just before folding the
omelet put a tablespoonful of peas in the center, fold, and turn out
on a heated platter. pour the remaining quantity of peas around the
omelet, and send at once to the table. if you like, you may pour over,
also, a half pint of cream sauce.


havana omelet

of salt and a dash of red pepper. cook until the tomato is soft. make
a six-egg omelet. turn it onto a heated platter, put the tomato
mixture at the ends, and send at once to the table.

hot saucepan and shake until the gills curl. rub together two level
tablespoonfuls of flour and two of butter. drain the oysters, put the
liquor into a half-pint cup, add sufficient milk to fill the cup. add
this to the butter and flour. when boiling, add the oysters, a level
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of red pepper. make a six-egg omelet,
turn it onto a heated dish, arrange the oysters around the omelet,
pour over the cream sauce, and send to the table.


omelet with sweetbreads

this is a very good way to make sweetbreads do double duty. boil a
pair of sweetbreads until they are tender. remove the membrane, cut
them into slices; make a cream sauce. add the sweetbreads, and, if you
like, a half can of chopped mushrooms. make a six-egg omelet, arrange
the slices of sweetbread around the omelet and pour over the cream
sauce.


omelet with tomatoes

beat six eggs. add a half pint of rather thick stewed tomatoes, a
level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. beat the eggs
and tomatoes together, and make precisely the same as a plain omelet.
do not, however, add water, as the tomatoes answer the purpose.

mix a half cup of chopped ham with the eggs after they have been
beaten with the water, and finish the same as a plain omelet.


omelet with cheese

pepper, a tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of
onion juice. put six thin slices of bacon in the omelet pan. cook
slowly until all the fat is tried out. remove the bacon, add a
tablespoonful of chopped onion. cook until the onion is slightly
brown, turn in the eggs and finish the same as a plain omelet. turn
onto a heated platter, garnish with red and green peppers, and, if you
like, put two tablespoonfuls of stewed tomatoes at each end of the
omelet.


omelet jardiniere

chop sufficient chives to make a tablespoonful. add a tablespoonful of
parsley, a tablespoonful of finely chopped onion, and, if you have it,
a little of the green tops of celery. mix this with six eggs, add six
tablespoonfuls of water and beat. make the same as a plain omelet.


omelet with fresh mushrooms

this is one of the most delicious of all the luncheon dishes. put two
tablespoonfuls of butter, a pound of mushrooms, sliced, a half cup of
milk and a teaspoonful of salt into a saucepan. cover and cook slowly
for twenty minutes. make two six-egg omelets. turn them, side by side,
on a large heated platter, pour over the fresh mushrooms and serve at
once.

or one whole raw tomato cut into bits, four sliced cooked okra, a
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper. let these cook twenty minutes.
make a six-egg plain omelet, using bacon fat instead of butter for the
cooking. remove the slices of bacon before they are too hard, as they
must be used for a garnish. turn the omelet onto a heated platter,
pour around it the pepper mixture, garnish with the bacon, and send to
the table. canned mushrooms may be added, if desired.


omelet with potatoes

    4 eggs

gradually to the mashed potato, beating all the while; add the salt
and pepper. put the butter into a good-sized saute or omelet pan; when
hot, turn the ingredients into the pan, and smooth it down with a
pallet knife. let this cook slowly until nicely browned; fold it over
as you would a plain omelet, and turn onto a heated dish. the parsley
may be sprinkled over the top, or added to the mixture.




sweet omelets


omelet a la washington

put three eggs into a bowl, and three into another bowl. add three
tablespoonfuls of water to each, and beat. have two omelet pans, in
which you have melted butter. grate an apple into one bowl, and into
the other put a little salt and pepper. stand two tablespoonfuls of
jelly in a dish over hot water while you cook the omelets. proceed as
for plain omelet. the one to which you have added the apple, turn out
on a plate. before folding the other, put in the center the softened
currant jelly, then fold it and turn it out by the side of the other
omelet. dust both with powdered sugar, and send at once to the table.
serve a portion of each.


omelet with rum

it with powdered sugar, and score it across the top with a red-hot
poker. dip four lumps of sugar into jamaica rum and put them on the
platter. put over the omelet four tablespoonfuls of rum; touch a
lighted match to the rum, and carry the omelet to the table, burning.
baste it with the burning rum until the alcohol is entirely burned
off.


swiss souffle

allow one egg to each person. have everything in readiness. the
maraschino cherries must be drained free from the liquor. separate the
eggs. beat the whites until they are stiff. add a level tablespoonful
of powdered sugar to each white, and beat until dry and glossy. add
the yolks of three eggs. mix quickly. add the grated rind of one lemon
and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. heap this into individual dishes.
make a tiny little hole in the center and put in a maraschino cherry,
leaving the hole large enough to hold a tablespoonful of the liquor
when the omelet is ready to serve; dust it with powdered sugar, bake
in a quick oven about three minutes, take it from the oven, pour in
the maraschino juice and send _at once_ to the table. these will fall
if baked too much, but when well made and served quickly, is one of
the daintiest of desserts.


omelet a la duchesse

this is a sweet baked omelet, and is
served the same as one would serve an omelet
souffle.

    6 eggs
  1/2 cupful of water
  1/2 a lemon's yellow rind, grated
  1/2 cupful of thick cream
  1/2 cupful of granulated sugar
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla or orange flower water
    1 small bit of cinnamon

put the sugar, water, cinnamon and lemon rind over the fire, boil
until it spins a thread and stand aside to cool. separate the eggs;
beat the yolks until creamy, and add the cream, then the strained
syrup. add the vanilla, and when cool fold in the well-beaten whites.
turn at once into a shallow silver or granite dish, dust thickly with
powdered sugar and bake in a quick oven until brown.


omelet souffle

this is, perhaps, one of the most difficult of all dishes to make.
when, however, you have accomplished the art, you have one of the most
satisfactory desserts. like the preceding recipe, it must be made at
the last moment and sent from the oven directly to the table. the eggs
must be beaten to just the right point and the oven must be very hot.
get everything in readiness before beginning to make the souffle.

select a bowl, perfectly clean, and arrange the star tube and pastry
bag, if you are going to use one. if not, get out a baking dish. sift
six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. separate six eggs. put three of
the yolks aside (as you will only use three), and beat the other three
until creamy. beat the whites until they are very stiff but not dry or
broken. now add three tablespoonfuls of the sifted powdered sugar.
beat for fully ten minutes. then add the beaten yolks, the grated rind
of a lemon and at the last a tablespoonful of lemon juice. mix
carefully and quickly, but thoroughly. put four or five tablespoonfuls
of this in the bottom of a platter, or baking dish. put the remaining
quantity quickly in the pastry bag, and press it out into roses. it is
easier to make it in small rosettes all over the foundation. dust
quickly with the remaining three tablespoonfuls of sugar. bake in a
quick oven until golden brown. this will take about five minutes.
serve immediately. to be just right, this must be hot to the very
center, crisp on top, moist underneath. if baked too long, the moment
the top is touched it will fall, becoming stringy and unpalatable.

omelet souffles are frequently flavored with rum, which must be mixed
with the sugar. sometimes they are sprayed with sherry just as they
are taken from the oven. they may be built up into different forms,
and garnished with candied or maraschino cherries, or chopped nuts.
