book 57 philemon
001:001 paul, a prisoner for christ jesus, and timothy our brother:
        to philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer--
001:002 and to our sister apphia and our comrade archippus--
        as well as to the church in your house.
001:003 may grace be granted to you all, and peace, from god our father
        and the lord jesus christ.
001:004 i give continual thanks to my god while making mention of you,
        my brother, in my prayers,
001:005 because i hear of your love and of the faith which you
        have towards the lord jesus and which you manifest towards
        all god's people;
001:006 praying as i do, that their participation in your faith may
        result in others fully recognizing all the right affection
        that is in us toward christ.
001:007 for i have found great joy and comfort in your love,
        because the hearts of god's people have been, and are,
        refreshed through you, my brother.
001:008 therefore, though i might with christ's authority speak
        very freely and order you to do what is fitting,
001:009 it is for love's sake that--instead of that--although i am
        none other than paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner
        for christ jesus,
001:010 i entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father i have
        become while in my chains--i mean onesimus.
001:011 formerly he was useless to you, but now--true to his name--
        he is of great use to you and to me.
001:012 i am sending him back to you, though in so doing i send
        part of myself.
001:013 it was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend
        to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment
        for the good news.
001:014 only i wished to do nothing without your consent, so that
        his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure,
        but might be a voluntary one.
001:015 for perhaps it was for this reason he was parted from you for a time,
        that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;
001:016 no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave--
        a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you,
        both as a servant and as a fellow christian.
001:017 if therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if
        he were i myself.
001:018 and if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt, debit me
        with the amount.
001:019 i paul write this with my own hand--i will pay you in full.
        (i say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)
001:020 yes, brother, do me this favour for the lord's sake.
        refresh my heart in christ.
001:021 i write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes,
        for i know you will do even more than i say.
001:022 and at the same time provide accommodation for me; for i hope
        that through your prayers i shall be permitted to come to you.
001:023 greetings to you, my brother, from epaphras my fellow prisoner
        for the sake of christ jesus;
001:024 and from mark, aristarchus, demas, and luke, my fellow workers.
001:025 may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with the spirit
        of every one of you.
