book 49 ephesians
001:001 paul, an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god:  to god's
        people who are in ephesus--believers in christ jesus.
001:002 may grace and peace be granted to you from god our father
        and the lord jesus christ.
001:003 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ,
        who has crowned us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
        realms in christ;
001:004 even as, in his love, he chose us as his own in christ before
        the creation of the world, that we might be holy and without
        blemish in his presence.
001:005 for he pre-destined us to be adopted by himself as sons through
        jesus christ--such being his gracious will and pleasure--
001:006 to the praise of the splendour of his grace with which he has
        enriched us in the beloved one.
001:007 it is in him, and through the shedding of his blood, that we
        have our deliverance--the forgiveness of our offences--
        so abundant was god's grace,
001:008 the grace which he, the possessor of all wisdom and understanding,
        lavished upon us,
001:009 when he made known to us the secret of his will.
        and this is in harmony with god's merciful purpose
001:010 for the government of the world when the times are ripe for it--
        the purpose which he has cherished in his own mind of restoring
        the whole creation to find its one head in christ; yes, things in
        heaven and things on earth, to find their one head in him.
001:011 in him we jews have been made heirs, having been chosen
        beforehand in accordance with the intention of him whose
        might carries out in everything the design of his own will,
001:012 so that we should be devoted to the extolling of his
        glorious attributes--we who were the first to fix our
        hopes on christ.
001:013 and in him you gentiles also, after listening to the message
        of the truth, the good news of your salvation--having believed
        in him--were sealed with the promised holy spirit;
001:014 that spirit being a pledge and foretaste of our inheritance,
        in anticipation of its full redemption--the inheritance
        which he has purchased to be specially his for the extolling
        of his glory.
001:015 for this reason i too, having heard of the faith in the lord jesus
        which prevails among you, and of your love for all god's people,
001:016 offer never ceasing thanks on your behalf while i make mention
        of you in my prayers.
001:017 for i always beseech the god of our lord jesus christ--
        the father most glorious--to give you a spirit of wisdom
        and penetration through an intimate knowledge of him,
001:018 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened so that you
        may know what is the hope which his call to you inspires,
        what the wealth of the glory of his inheritance in god's people,
001:019 and what the transcendent greatness of his power in us believers
        as seen in the working of his infinite might
001:020 when he displayed it in christ by raising him from the dead
        and seating him at his own right hand in the heavenly realms,
001:021 high above all other government and authority and power
        and dominion, and every title of sovereignty used either
        in this age or in the age to come.
001:022 god has put all things under his feet, and has appointed him
        universal and supreme head of the church, which is his body,
001:023 the completeness of him who everywhere fills the universe
        with himself.
002:001 to you gentiles also, who were dead through your offences and sins,
002:002 which were once habitual to you while you walked in the ways
        of this world and obeyed the prince of the powers of the air,
        the spirits that are now at work in the hearts of the sons
        of disobedience--to you god has given life.
002:003 among them all of us also formerly passed our lives, governed by
        the inclinations of our lower natures, indulging the cravings
        of those natures and of our own thoughts, and were in our
        original state deserving of anger like all others.
002:004 but god, being rich in mercy, because of the intense love
        which he bestowed on us,
002:005 caused us, dead though we were through our offences, to live
        with christ--it is by grace that you have been saved--
002:006 raised us with him from the dead, and enthroned us with him
        in the heavenly realms as being in christ jesus,
002:007 in order that, by his goodness to us in christ jesus, he might
        display in the ages to come the transcendent riches of his grace.
002:008 for it is by grace that you have been saved through faith;
        and that not of yourselves.  it is god's gift, and is not on
        the ground of merit--
002:009 so that it may be impossible for any one to boast.
002:010 for we are god's own handiwork, created in christ jesus
        for good works which he has pre-destined us to practise.
002:011 therefore, do not forget that formerly you were gentiles as to
        your bodily condition.  you were called the uncircumcision
        by those who style themselves the circumcised--their circumcision
        being one which the knife has effected.
002:012 at that time you were living apart from christ, estranged from
        the commonwealth of israel, with no share by birth in the covenants
        which are based on the promises, and you had no hope and no god,
        in all the world.
002:013 but now in christ jesus you who once were so far away have been
        brought near through the death of christ.
002:014 for he is our peace--he who has made jews and gentiles one, and in
        his own human nature has broken down the hostile dividing wall,
002:015 by setting aside the law with its commandments, expressed,
        as they were, in definite decrees.  his design was to unite
        the two sections of humanity in himself so as to form
        one new man,
002:016 thus effecting peace, and to reconcile jews and gentiles
        in one body to god, by means of his cross--slaying by it
        their mutual enmity.
002:017 so he came and proclaimed good news of peace to you who were
        so far away, and peace to those who were near;
002:018 because it is through him that jews and gentiles alike have
        access through one spirit to the father.
002:019 you are therefore no longer mere foreigners or persons excluded
        from civil rights.  on the contrary you share citizenship
        with god's people and are members of his family.
002:020 you are a building which has been reared on the foundation
        of the apostles and prophets, the cornerstone being
        christ jesus himself,
002:021 in union with whom the whole fabric, fitted and closely
        joined together, is growing so as to form a holy sanctuary
        in the lord;
002:022 in whom you also are being built up together to become a fixed
        abode for god through the spirit.
003:001 for this reason i paul, the prisoner of christ jesus on behalf
        of you gentiles--
003:002 if, that is, you have heard of the work which god has graciously
        entrusted to me for your benefit,
003:003 and that by a revelation the truth hitherto kept secret was made
        known to me as i have already briefly explained it to you.
003:004 by means of that explanation, as you read it, you can judge
        of my insight into the truth of christ
003:005 which in earlier ages was not made known to the human race,
        as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets
        through the spirit--
003:006 i mean the truth that the gentiles are joint heirs with us jews,
        and that they form one body with us, and have the same
        interest as we have in the promise which has been made good
        in christ jesus through the good news,
003:007 in which i have been appointed to serve, in virtue of
        the work which god, in the exercise of his power within me,
        has graciously entrusted to me.
003:008 to me who am less than the least of all god's people has this
        work been graciously entrusted--to proclaim to the gentiles
        the good news of the exhaustless wealth of christ,
003:009 and to show all men in a clear light what my stewardship is.
        it is the stewardship of the truth which from all the ages
        lay concealed in the mind of god, the creator of all things--
003:010 concealed in order that the church might now be used to
        display to the powers and authorities in the heavenly realms
        the innumerable aspects of god's wisdom.
003:011 such was the eternal purpose which he had formed in
        christ jesus our lord,
003:012 in whom we have this bold and confident access through our
        faith in him.
003:013 therefore i entreat you not to lose heart in the midst of my
        sufferings on your behalf, for they bring you honour.
003:014 for this reason, on bended knee i beseech the father,
003:015 from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
003:016 to grant you--in accordance with the wealth of his
        glorious perfections--to be strengthened by his spirit
        with power penetrating to your inmost being.
003:017 i pray that christ may make his home in your hearts through
        your faith; so that having your roots deep and your foundations
        strong, in love, you may become mighty to grasp the idea,
003:018 as it is grasped by all god's people, of the breadth and length,
        the height and depth--
003:019 yes, to attain to a knowledge of the knowledge-surpassing love
        of christ, so that you may be made complete in accordance
        with god's own standard of completeness.
003:020 now to him who, in exercise of his power that is at work
        within us, is able to do infinitely beyond all our highest
        prayers or thoughts--
003:021 to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus to
        all generations, world without end!  amen.
004:001 i, then, the prisoner for the master's sake, entreat you
        to live and act as becomes those who have received the call
        that you have received--
004:002 with all lowliness of mind and unselfishness, and with patience,
        bearing with one another lovingly, and earnestly
        striving to maintain,
004:003 in the uniting bond of peace, the unity given by the spirit.
004:004 there is but one body and but one spirit, as also when you
        were called you had one and the same hope held out to you.
004:005 there is but one lord, one faith, one baptism,
004:006 and one god and father of all, who rules over all, acts through all,
        and dwells in all.
004:007 yet to each of us individually grace was given, measured out
        with the munificence of christ.
004:008 for this reason scripture says:  "he re-ascended on high,
        he led captive a host of captives, and gave gifts to men."
004:009 (now this "re-ascended"--what does it mean but that he had
        first descended into the lower regions of the earth?
004:010 he who descended is the same as he who ascended again far
        above all the heavens in order to fill the universe.)
004:011 and he himself appointed some to be apostles, some to be prophets,
        some to be evangelists, some to be pastors and teachers,
004:012 in order fully to equip his people for the work of serving--
        for the building up of christ's body--
004:013 till we all of us arrive at oneness in faith and in the knowledge
        of the son of god, and at mature manhood and the stature
        of full-grown men in christ.
004:014 so we shall no longer be babes nor shall we resemble mariners
        tossed on the waves and carried about with every changing wind
        of doctrine according to men's cleverness and unscrupulous cunning,
        making use of every shifting device to mislead.
004:015 but we shall lovingly hold to the truth, and shall in all respects
        grow up into union with him who is our head, even christ.
004:016 dependent on him, the whole body--its various parts closely
        fitting and firmly adhering to one another--grows by the aid
        of every contributory link, with power proportioned to
        the need of each individual part, so as to build itself up
        in a spirit of love.
004:017 therefore i warn you, and i implore you in the name of the master,
        no longer to live as the gentiles in their perverseness live,
004:018 with darkened understandings, having by reason of the ignorance
        which is deep-seated in them and the insensibility of their
        moral nature, no share in the life which god gives.
004:019 such men being past feeling have abandoned themselves to impurity,
        greedily indulging in every kind of profligacy.
004:020 but these are not the lessons which you have learned from christ;
004:021 if at least you have heard his voice and in him have been taught--
        and this is true christian teaching--
004:022 to put away, in regard to your former mode of life,
        your original evil nature which is doomed to perish as befits
        its misleading impulses,
004:023 and to get yourselves renewed in the temper of your minds
        and clothe yourselves
004:024 with that new and better self which has been created to resemble
        god in the righteousness and holiness which come from the truth.
004:025 for this reason, laying aside falsehood, every one of you should
        speak the truth to his fellow man; for we are, as it were,
        parts of one another.
004:026 if angry, beware of sinning.  let not your irritation last until
        the sun goes down;
004:027 and do not leave room for the devil.
004:028 he who has been a thief must steal no more, but, instead of that,
        should work with his own hands in honest industry, so that
        he may have something of which he can give the needy a share.
004:029 let no unwholesome words ever pass your lips, but let all your
        words be good for benefiting others according to the need
        of the moment, so that they may be a means of blessing
        to the hearers.
004:030 and beware of grieving the holy spirit of god, in whom you
        have been sealed in preparation for the day of redemption.
004:031 let all bitterness and all passionate feeling, all anger
        and loud insulting language, be unknown among you--
        and also every kind of malice.
004:032 on the contrary learn to be kind to one another, tender-hearted,
        forgiving one another, just as god in christ has also forgiven you.
005:001 therefore be imitators of god, as his dear children.
005:002 and live and act lovingly, as christ also loved you and gave
        himself up to death on our behalf as an offering and sacrifice
        to god, yielding a fragrant odor.
005:003 but fornication and every kind of impurity, or covetousness,
        let them not even be mentioned among you, for they ought
        not to be named among god's people.
005:004 avoid shameful and foolish talk and low jesting--they are all
        alike discreditable--and in place of these give thanks.
005:005 for be well assured that no fornicator or immoral person
        and no money-grubber--or in other words idol-worshipper--
        has any share awaiting him in the kingdom of christ and of god.
005:006 let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is on account
        of these very sins that god's anger is coming upon the disobedient.
005:007 therefore do not become sharers with them.
005:008 there was a time when you were nothing but darkness.
        now, as christians, you are light itself.
005:009 live and act as sons of light--for the effect of the light
        is seen in every kind of goodness, uprightness and truth--
005:010 and learn in your own experiences what is fully pleasing
        to the lord.
005:011 have nothing to do with the barren unprofitable deeds
        of darkness, but, instead of that, set your faces against them;
005:012 for the things which are done by these people in secret it
        is disgraceful even to speak of.
005:013 but everything can be tested by the light and thus be shown
        in its true colors; for whatever shines of itself is light.
005:014 for this reason it is said, "rise, sleeper; rise from among
        the dead, and christ will shed light upon you."
005:015 therefore be very careful how you live and act.
        let it not be as unwise men, but as wise.
005:016 buy up your opportunities, for these are evil times.
005:017 on this account do not prove yourselves wanting in sense,
        but try to understand what the lord's will is.
005:018 do not over-indulge in wine--a thing in which excess is so easy--
005:019 but drink deeply of god's spirit.  speak to one another with
        psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.  sing and offer praise
        in your hearts to the lord.
005:020 always and for everything let your thanks to god the father
        be presented in the name of our lord jesus christ;
005:021 and submit to one another out of reverence for christ.
005:022 married women, submit to your own husbands as if to the lord;
005:023 because a husband is the head of his wife as christ also is the head
        of the church, being indeed the saviour of this his body.
005:024 and just as the church submits to christ, so also married
        women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.
005:025 married men, love your wives, as christ also loved the church
        and gave himself up to death for her;
005:026 in order to make her holy, cleansing her with the baptismal
        water by the word,
005:027 that he might present the church to himself a glorious bride,
        without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be
        holy and unblemished.
005:028 so too married men ought to love their wives as much as they
        love themselves.  he who loves his wife loves himself.
005:029 for never yet has a man hated his own body.  on the contrary
        he feeds and cherishes it, just as christ feeds and
        cherishes the church;
005:030 because we are, as it were, parts of his body.
005:031 "for this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother
        and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one."
005:032 that is a great truth hitherto kept secret:  i mean the truth
        concerning christ and the church.
005:033 yet i insist that among you also, each man is to love his own
        wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman
        see to it that she treats her husband with respect.
006:001 children, be obedient to your parents as a christian duty,
        for it is a duty.
006:002 "honour your father and your mother"--this is the first
        commandment which has a promise added to it--
006:003 "so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long
        on the earth."
006:004 and you, fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring
        them up tenderly with true christian training and advice.
006:005 slaves, be obedient to your earthly masters, with respect
        and eager anxiety to please and with simplicity of motive
        as if you were obeying christ.
006:006 let it not be in acts of eye-service as if you had but to
        please men, but as christ's bondservants who are doing god's
        will from the heart.
006:007 with right good will, be faithful to your duty as service
        rendered to the lord and not to man.
006:008 you well know that whatever right thing any one does, he will
        receive a requital for it from the lord, whether he is a slave
        or a free man.
006:009 and you masters, act towards your slaves on the same principles,
        and refrain from threats.  for you know that in heaven there
        is one who is your master as well as theirs, and that merely
        earthly distinctions there are none with him.
006:010 in conclusion, strengthen yourselves in the lord and in the power
        which his supreme might imparts.
006:011 put on the complete armour of god, so as to be able to stand
        firm against all the stratagems of the devil.
006:012 for ours is not a conflict with mere flesh and blood,
        but with the despotisms, the empires, the forces that control
        and govern this dark world--the spiritual hosts of evil
        arrayed against us in the heavenly warfare.
006:013 therefore put on the complete armour of god, so that you
        may be able to stand your ground on the day of battle, and,
        having fought to the end, to remain victors on the field.
006:014 stand therefore, first fastening round you the girdle of truth
        and putting on the breastplate of uprightness
006:015 as well as the shoes of the good news of peace--a firm foundation
        for your feet.
006:016 and besides all these take the great shield of faith,
        on which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts
        of the wicked one;
006:017 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit
        which is the word of god.
006:018 pray with unceasing prayer and entreaty on every fitting
        occasion in the spirit, and be always on the alert to seize
        opportunities for doing so, with unwearied persistence
        and entreaty on behalf of all god's people,
006:019 and ask on my behalf that words may be given to me so that,
        outspoken and fearless, i may make known the truths
        (hitherto kept secret) of the good news--
006:020 to spread which i am an ambassador in chains--so that when
        telling them i may speak out boldly as i ought.
006:021 but in order that you also may know how i am doing, tychicus our
        dearly-loved brother and faithful helper in the lord's service
        will tell you everything.
006:022 i have sent him to you for the very purpose--that you may know
        about us and that he may encourage you.
006:023 peace be to the brethren, and love combined with faith,
        from god the father and the lord jesus christ.
006:024 may grace be with all who love our lord jesus christ
        with perfect sincerity.
