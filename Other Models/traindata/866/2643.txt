book 63 2 john
001:001 the elder to the elect lady and her children.  truly i love
        you all, and not i alone, but also all who know the truth,
001:002 for the sake of the truth which is continually in our hearts
        and will be with us for ever.
001:003 grace, mercy and peace will be with us from god the father,
        and from jesus christ the son of the father, in truth and love.
001:004 it is an intense joy to me to have found some of your children
        living true christian lives, in obedience to the command
        which we have received from the father.
001:005 and now, dear lady, i pray you--writing to you, as i do,
        not a new command, but the one which we have had from
        the very beginning--let us love one another.
001:006 the love of which i am speaking consists in our living in obedience
        to god's commands.  god's command is that you should live
        in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.
001:007 for many deceivers have gone out into the world--men who do not
        acknowledge jesus as christ who has come in human nature.
        such a one is `the deceiver' and `the anti-christ.'
001:008 keep guard over yourselves, so that you may not lose the results
        of your good deeds, but may receive back a full reward.
001:009 no one has god, who instead of remaining true to the teaching
        of christ, presses on in advance:  but he who remains true
        to that teaching has both the father and the son.
001:010 if any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching,
        do not receive him under your roof nor bid him farewell.
001:011 he who bids him farewell is a sharer in his evil deeds.
001:012 i have a great deal to say to you all, but will not write it
        with paper and ink.  yet i hope to come to see you and speak
        face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.
001:013 the children of your elect sister send greetings to you.



*** end of the project gutenberg ebook, weymouth new testament in modern speech, 2 john ***

this file should be named wnt2410.txt or wnt2410.zip
corrected editions of our ebooks get a new number, wnt2411.txt
versions based on separate sources get new letter, wnt2410a.txt

project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the us
unless a copyright notice is included.  thus, we usually do not
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

we are now trying to release all our ebooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
the official release date of all project gutenberg ebooks is at
midnight, central time, of the last day of the stated month.  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

most people start at our web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

these web sites include award-winning information about project
gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


those of you who want to download any ebook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the project gutenberg newsletter.

information about project gutenberg (one page)

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  the
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any ebook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  if the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more ebooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
we are already on our way to trying for 2000 more ebooks in 2002
if they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion ebooks given away by year's end.

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away 1 trillion ebooks!
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
