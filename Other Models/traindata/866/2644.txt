book 64 3 john
001:001 the elder to his dear friend gaius.  truly i love you.
001:002 my dear friend, i pray that you may in all respects prosper
        and enjoy good health, just as your soul already prospers.
001:003 for it is an intense joy to me when brethren come and bear witness
        to your fidelity to the truth--that you live in obedience
        to the truth.
001:004 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children are living
        in obedience to the truth.
001:005 my dear friend, you are acting faithfully in all your behaviour
        towards the brethren, even when they are strangers to you.
001:006 they have testified, in the presence of the church, to your love;
        and you will do well to help them on their journey in a manner
        worthy of your fellowship with god.
001:007 for it is for christ that they have gone forth, accepting nothing
        from the gentiles.
001:008 it is therefore our duty to show hospitality to such men,
        so that we may be fellow workers in promoting the truth.
001:009 i wrote to the church, but diotrephes, who loves to have
        the first place among them, refuses to listen to us.
001:010 for this reason, if i come, i shall not forget his conduct,
        nor his idle and mischievous talk against us.  and he does
        not stop there:  he not only will not receive the brethren,
        but those who desire to do this he hinders, and excludes them
        from the church.
001:011 my dear friend, do not follow wrong examples, but right ones.
        he who habitually does what is right is a child of god:
        he who habitually does what is wrong has not seen god.
001:012 the character of demetrius has the approval of all men,
        and of the truth itself.  we also express our approval of it,
        and you know that we only give our approval to that which is true.
001:013 i have a great deal to say to you, but i do not wish to go
        on writing it with ink and pen.
001:014 but i hope to see you very soon, and then we will speak face to face.
        peace be with you.  our friends send greetings to you.
        greet our friends individually.



*** end of the project gutenberg ebook, weymouth new testament in modern speech, 3 john ***

this file should be named wnt2510.txt or wnt2510.zip
corrected editions of our ebooks get a new number, wnt2511.txt
versions based on separate sources get new letter, wnt2510a.txt

project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the us
unless a copyright notice is included.  thus, we usually do not
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

we are now trying to release all our ebooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
the official release date of all project gutenberg ebooks is at
midnight, central time, of the last day of the stated month.  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

most people start at our web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

these web sites include award-winning information about project
gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


those of you who want to download any ebook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the project gutenberg newsletter.

information about project gutenberg (one page)

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  the
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any ebook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  if the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more ebooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
we are already on our way to trying for 2000 more ebooks in 2002
if they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion ebooks given away by year's end.

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away 1 trillion ebooks!
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
