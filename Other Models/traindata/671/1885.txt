editor's introduction


the matter which is given to the public in this book will speak with a
voice of its own; it is necessary, however, to say a few words in advance
to inform the reader of its history.

the writer of the journal herein contained was not known, i believe,
to more than a dozen people in this huge city in which he lived. i am
quite certain that i and my wife were the only persons he ever called his
friends. i met him shortly after his graduation from college, and for the
past few years i knew, and i alone, of a life of artistic devotion of such
passionate fervor as i expect never to meet with again.

arthur stirling was entirely a self-educated man; he had worked at i know
not how many impossible occupations, and labored in the night-time like
the heroes one reads about. he taught himself to read five languages, and
at the time when i saw him last he knew more great poetry by heart than
any man of letters that i have ever met. he was the author of one book,
a tragedy in blank verse, called the captive; that drama forms the chief
theme of this journal. for the rest, it seems to me enough to quote this
notice, which appeared in the new york times for june 9, 1902.

  stirling.--by suicide in the hudson river, poet and
     man of genius, in the 22d year of his age, only son of
     richard t. and grace stirling, deceased, of chicago.
       chicago papers please copy.

arthur stirling was in appearance a tall, dark-haired boy--he was really
only a boy--with a singularly beautiful face, and a strange wistful
expression of the eyes that i think will haunt me as long as i live. i made
him, somewhat externally and feebly, i fear, one of the characters in a
recently published novel. that he was a lonely spirit will be plain enough
from his writings; he lived among the poverty-haunted thousands of this
city, without (so he once told me) ever speaking to a living soul for a
week. pecuniarily i could not help him--for though he was poor, i was
scarcely less so. at the time of his frightful death i had not seen him for
nearly two months--owing to circumstances which were in no way my fault,
but for which i can nevertheless not forgive myself.

the writing of the captive, as described in these papers, was begun in
april, 1901. i was myself at that time in the midst of a struggle to have
a book published. it was not really published until late in that year--at
which time the captive was finished and already several times rejected.
it was an understood thing between us that should my book succeed it would
mean freedom for both of us, but that, unfortunately, was not to be.

early in april of 1902 i had succeeded in laying by provisions enough to
last me while i wrote another book, and i fled away to put up my tent in
the wilderness. the last time that i ever saw arthur stirling was in his
room the night before i left. he smiled very bravely and said that he would
keep his courage up, that he was pretty sure he would come out all right.

i did not expect him to write often--i knew that he was too poor for that;
but after six weeks had passed and i had not heard from him at all, i
wrote to a friend to go and see him. it developed that he had moved. the
lodging-house keeper could only say that he had left her his baggage, being
unable to pay his rent; and that he "looked sick." where he went she did
not know, and all efforts of mine to find him were of no avail. the only
person that i knew of to ask was a certain young girl, a typewriter, who
had known him for years, and who had worshiped him with a strange and
terrible passion--who would have been his wife, or his slave, if he had not
been as iron in such things, a man so lost in his vision that i suppose he
always thought she was lost in it too. this girl had copied his manuscripts
for years, with the plea that he might pay her when he "succeeded"; and she
has all of his manuscripts now, except what i have, if she is alive. all
that we could learn was that she had "gone away"; i feel pretty certain
that she went in search of him.

in addition, all that i have to tell is that on monday, june 9th last i
received a large express package from arthur. it was sent from new york,
but marked as coming from another person--evidently to avoid giving an
address of his own. upon opening it i found two packages, one of them
carefully sealed and marked upon the outside, the captive; the other was
the manuscript of this journal, and upon the top of it was the following
letter:

    my dear ----: you have no doubt been wondering what has become
    of me. i have been having a hard time of it. i wish i could
    find some way to make this thing a little easier, but i can
    not. when you read this letter i shall be dead. there is
    nothing that i can tell you about it that you will not read in
    the papers i send you. it is simply that i was born to be an
    artist, and that as anything else i can not live. the burden
    that has been laid upon me i can not bear another day. i have
    told the whole story of it in this book--i have kept myself
    alive for months, sick and weeping with agony, in order that i
    might tear it out of my heart and get it written. it has been
    my last prayer that the struggle my life has been may somehow
    not be useless. there will come others after me--others perhaps
    keener than i--and oh, the world must not kill them all!

    you will take this manuscript, please, and go over it, and cut
    out what you like to make it printable, and write a few words
    to make people understand about it. and then see if any one
    will publish it. you know more about all these things than i
    do. if it should sell, keep part of the money for your own
    work and give the rest to poor ellen. as to the captive--i
    all but burned it, as you will read; but keep it, sealed as
    i have sealed it, for two years, and then offer it to some
    publishers--to others than the nine who have already rejected
    it. if you can not find any one to take it, then burn it, or
    keep it for love, i do not care which.

    i am writing this on thursday night, and i am almost dead. i
    mean to get some money to-morrow, and then to buy a ticket for
    as far up the hudson as i can go. in the evening i mean to find
    a steep bank, and, with a heavy dumb-bell i have bought, and
    a strong rope, i think i can find the peace that i have been
    seeking.

    the first thing that i have to say to you about it is, that
    when you get this letter it will be over and done, and that i
    want you, for god's sake, not to make any fuss. no one will
    find my body and no one will care about it. you need not think
    it necessary to notify the newspapers--what i'm sending you
    here is literature and not journalism. i have no earthly
    belongings left except these mss., upon which you will have to
    pay the toll. i have written to m----, a man who once did some
    typewriting for me, asking him to use a dollar he owes me in
    putting a notice in one of the papers. i suppose i owe that to
    the people out west.

    i can't write you to-night--before god i can't; my head is going
    like a steel-mill, and i'm _so_ sick. you will get over
    this somehow, and go on and do your task and win. and if the
    memory of my prayer can help you, that will be something. do
    the work of both of us if you can. only, if you do pull through,
    remember my last cry--remember the young artist! there is no
    other fight so worth fighting--take it upon you--shout it day
    and night at them--what things they do with their young artists!

    god bless you, dear friend. yours, arthur.

the above is the only tidings of him, excepting the extended accounts of
his death which appeared in the new york times and the new york world for
june 10 and 11, 1902, and several letters which he wrote to other people.
there remains only to say a few words as to the journal.

it is scrawled upon old note-books and loose sheets of paper. the matter,
although a diary, contains odd bits of his writings--one of two letters
to me which he had me send back, and some extracts from an essay which
a friend of mine was offering at that time to magazines in the hope of
placing it for him. there is a problem about the work which i leave
to others to solve--how much of it was written as dated, and how much
afterward, as a piece of art, as a testament of his sorrow. parts of it
have struck me as having been composed in the latter way, and the last
pages, of course, imply as much.

extraordinary pages they are to me. that a man who was about to take his
life should have written them is one of the strangest cases of artistic
absorption i know of in literature. but arthur stirling was a man lost in
his art just so--so full of it, so drunk with it, that nothing in life had
other meaning to him. to quote the words he loved, from the last of his
heroes, he longed for excellence "as the lion longs for his food."

so he lived and so he worked; the world had no use for his work, and so he
died.

reader:

i do not know if "the valley of the shadow" means to you what it means to
me; i do not know if it means anything at all to you. but i have sought
long and far for these words, to utter an all but unutterable thought.

when you walk in the forest you do not count the lives that you tread into
nothingness. when you rejoice with the springtime you do not hear the cries
of the young things that are choked and beaten down and dying. when you
watch the wild thing in your snare you do not know the meaning of the torn
limbs, and the throbbing heart, and the awful silence of the creature
trapped. when you go where the poor live, and see thin faces and hungry
eyes and crouching limbs, you do not think of these things either.

but i, reader--i dwell in the valley of the shadow.

sometimes it is silent in my valley, and the creatures sit in terror of
their own voices; sometimes there are screams that pierce the sky; but
there is never any answer in my valley. there are quivering hands there,
and racked limbs, and aching hearts, and panting souls. there is gasping
struggle, glaring failure--maniac despair. for over my valley rolls _the
shadow_, a giant thing, moving with the weight of mountains. and you
stare at it, you feel it; you scream, you pray, you weep; you hold up your
hands to your god, you grow mad; but the shadow moves like time, like the
sun, and the planets in the sky. it rolls over you, and it rolls on; and
then you cry out no more.

it is that way in my valley. the shadow is the shadow of death.

the book! the book! this day, saturday, the sixth day of april, 1901, i
begin the book!

i have never kept a journal--i have been too busy living; but to-day i
begin a journal. i am so built that i can do but one thing at a time. now
that i have begun the captive, i must be haunted with it all day; when i
am not writing it i must be dreaming it, or restless because i am not.
therefore it occurred to me that in the hours of weariness i would write
about it what was in my mind--what fears and what hopes; why and how i
write it will be a story in itself, and some day i think it will be read.

       *       *       *       *       *

i have come to the last stage of the fight, and i see the goal. i will tell
the story, and by and by wise editors can print it in the appendix!

yesterday i was a cable-car conductor, and to-day i am a poet!

i know of some immortal poems that were written by a druggist's clerk, and
some by a gager of liquid barrels, but none by a cable-car conductor. "it
sounds interesting, tell us about it!" says the reader. i shall, but not
to-day.

to-day i begin the book!

i did not write that on april 6th, i wrote it a month ago--one day when i
was thinking about this. i put it there now, because it will do to begin;
but i had no jests in my heart on april 6th.

       *       *       *       *       *

april 10th.

i have been for four days in a kind of frenzy. i have come down like a
collapsed balloon, and i think i have had enough for once.

i have written the opening scene, but not finally; and then i got into the
middle--i could not help it. how in god's name i am ever to do this fearful
thing, i don't know; it frightens me, and sometimes i lose all heart.

       *       *       *       *       *

i suppose i shall have to begin again tonight. i must eat something first,
though. that is one of my handicaps: i wear myself out and have to stop and
eat. will anybody ever love me for this work, will anybody ever understand
it?

i suppose i can get back where i was yesterday, but always it grows harder,
and more stern. i set my teeth together.

       *       *       *       *       *

it was like the bursting of an overstrained dam, these last four days. how
long i have been pent up--eighteen months! and eighteen months seems like a
lifetime to me. i have been a bloodhound in the leash, hungering--hungering
for this thing, and the longing has piled up in me day by day. sometimes it
has been more than i could bear; and when the time was near, i was so wild
that i was sick. the book! the book! freedom and the book!

and last saturday i went out of the hell-house where i have been pent so
long, and i covered my face with my hands and fled away home--away to the
little corner that is mine. there i flung myself down and sobbed like a
child. it was relief--it was joy--it was fear! it was everything! the
book! the book! then i got up--and the world seemed to go behind me, and
i was drunk. i heard a voice calling--it thundered in my ears--that i was
free--that my hour was come--that i might live--that i might live--live!
and i could have shouted it--i know that i laughed it aloud. every time i
thought the thought it was like the throbbing of wings to me--"free! free!"

no one can understand this--no one who has not a demon in his soul. no one
who does not know how i have been choked--what horrors i have borne.

i am through with that--i did not think of that. i am free! they will never
have me back.

that motive alone would drive me to my work, would make me dare _anything_.
but i do not need that motive.

       *       *       *       *       *

i think only of the book. i thought of it last saturday, and it swept me
away out of myself. i had planned the opening scene; but then the thought
of the triumph-song took hold of me, and it drove me mad. that song was
what i had thought i could never do--i had never dared to think of it.
and it came to me--it came! wild, incoherent, overwhelming, it came, the
victorious hymn. i could not think of remembering it; it was not poetry--it
was reality. _i_ was the captive, _i_ had won freedom--a faith and a
vision!

so it throbbed on and on, and i was choked, and my head on fire, and my
hands tingling, until i sank down from sheer exhaustion--laughing and
sobbing, and talking to god as if he were in the room. i never really
believe in god except at such times; i can go through this dreadful world
for months, and never think if there be a god.--here i sit gossiping about
it.--but i am tired out.

       *       *       *       *       *

the writing of a book is like the bearing of a child. but every birth-pang
of the former lasts for hours; and it is months before the labor is done.

it is not merely the vision, the hour of exultation; that is but the
setting of the task. now you will take that ecstasy, and hold on to it,
hold on with soul and body; you will keep yourself at that height, you
will hold that flaming glory before your eyes, and you will hammer it
into words. yes, that is the terror--into words--into words that leap the
hilltops, that bring the ends of existence together in a lightning flash.
you will take them as they come, white-hot, in wild tumult, and you will
forge them, and force them. you will seize them in your naked hands and
wrestle with them, and bend them to your will--all that is the making of
a poem. and last and worst of all, you will hold them in your memory, the
long, long surge of them; the torrent of whirling thought--you will hold it
in your memory! you are dazed with excitement, exhausted with your toil,
trembling with pain; but you have built a tower out of cards, and you have
mounted to the clouds upon it, and there you are poised. and anything
that happens--anything!--ah, god, why can the poet not escape from his
senses?--a sound, a touch--and it is gone!

these things drive you mad.--

but meanwhile it is not gone yet. you have still a whole scene in your
consciousness--as if you were a juggler, tossing a score of golden balls.
and all the time, while you work, you learn it--you learn it! it is
endless, but you learn it. in the midst of it, perhaps, you come down of
sheer exhaustion; and you lie there, panting, shuddering, your hands moist;
you dare not think, you wait. and then by and by you begin again--if
it will not come, you _make_ it come, you lash yourself like a dumb
beast--up, up, to the mountain-tops again. and then once more the thing
comes back--you live the scene again, as an actor does, and you shape it
and you master it. and now in the midst of it, you find this highest of all
moments is gone! it is gone, and you can not find it! those words that came
as a trumpet-clash, burning your very flesh--that melody that melted your
whole being to tears--they are gone--you can not find them! you search and
you search--but you can not find them. and so you stumble on, in despair
and agony; and still you dare not rest. you dare not ever rest in this
until the thing is done--done and over--until you have _nailed_ it
fast. so you go back again, though perhaps you are so tired that you are
fainting; but you fight yourself like a madman, you struggle until you feel
a thing at your heart like a wild beast; and you keep on, you hold it fast
and learn it, clinch it tight, and make it yours forever. i have done that
same thing five times to-day without a rest; and toiled for five hours in
that frenzy; and then lain down upon the ground, with my head on fire.

afterward when you have recovered you sit down, and for two or three hours
you write; you have it whole in your memory now--you have but to put it
down. and this forlorn, wet, bedraggled thing--this miserable, stammering,
cringing thing--_this_ is your poem!

       *       *       *       *       *

some day the world will realize these things, and then they will present
their poor poets with diamonds and palaces, and other things that do not
help.

i wrote this, and then i leaned back, tired out. my thoughts turned to
shakespeare, and while i was thinking of him--

  but, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
  walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill!

i have not done much to-day. i spent the morning brooding over the opening
speech. it is somber and terrible, but i have not gotten it right. it
must have a tread--a tread like an orchestra! ah, how i wish i had an
orchestra!--i would soon do it then--_"so bist nun ewig du verdammt!"_

the secret of the thing is iteration. i must find a word that is like a
hammer-stroke. i have tried twenty, but i have not found the one.

       *       *       *       *       *

--i spent the rest of the day thinking over the whole first act, mapping it
out, so to speak.

i have often fancied a resemblance between the captive and the c-minor
symphony; i wonder if any one else would have thought of it. it is not
merely the opening--it is the whole content of the thing--the struggle of a
prisoned spirit. i would call the captive a symphony, and print the c-minor
themes in it, only it would seem fanciful.--but it would not really be
fanciful to put the second theme opposite the thought of freedom--of the
blue sky and the dawning spring.

all except the scherzo. i couldn't find room for the scherzo. men who have
wrestled with the demons of hell do not tumble around like elephants, no
matter how happy they are. i wish i could take out beethoven's scherzos!

my heart leaps when i think of my one big step. i have put those pages
away--i shall not look at them again for a month. then i can judge them.

       *       *       *       *       *

april 13th.

a cable-car conductor and a poet! i think that will be a story worth
telling.

i have tried many and various occupations, but i have not found one so
favorable to the study of poetry as my last. i should have made out very
well--if i had not been haunted by the captive.

with everything else you do you are more or less hampered by having to sell
your brain; and also by having to obey some one. but a cable-car is an
unlimited monarchy; and all you have to do is to collect fares and pull
the bell, both of which duties are quite mechanical. and besides that you
receive princely wages--and can live off one-third of them, if you know
how; and that means that you need only work one-third of the time, and can
write your poetry the rest of it!

this sounds like jesting, but it is not. i have only been a cable-car
conductor six months, but in that time i have taught myself to read greek
with more than fluency. all you need is good health and spirits, a will of
iron, and a very tiny note-book in the palm of your hand, full of the words
you wish to learn. and then for ten or twelve hours a day you go about
running a car with your body--and with your mind--hammering, hammering!
it is excellent discipline--it is fighting all day, "_pous, podos_,
the foot--_pous, podos_, the foot--34th street, crosstown east and
west--_pous, podos_, the foot!"

and then when you get home late at night, are there not the great masters
who love you?

thou wouldst call thyself artist; thou wouldst have the eternal presence to
dwell within thee, to fire thy heart with passion and dower thy lips with
song; canst thou go into thy closet, and alone with thy maker, say these
words:

"o thou unthinkable, source of all light and life, thou the great unselfish
one, the great sufferer; thou seest my heart this day, how in it dwells but
love of thy truth and worship of thy holiness. thou seest that i seek not
wealth that men should serve me, nor fame that they should honor me, for
the glory that is thine. thou seest that i bring all my praise to thy feet,
that i love all things that thou hast made, that i envy no man thy gifts,
that i rejoice when thou sendest one stronger than i into the battle. and
when these things are not, may thy power leave me; for i seek but to dwell
in thy presence, and to speak thy truth, which can not die."

       *       *       *       *       *

that prayer welled up in my heart to-day. there are times when i sit before
this thing in my soul, crouching and gazing at it in fear. then i see
the naked horror of it, the shuddering reality of it. i see the soul:
motionless, tense, quivering, wrestling in an agony with the powers of
destruction. it is so real to me that my body stiffens into stone, and i
sit with the sweat on my forehead. that happened to me to-day, and i wrote
a few lines of the poem that made my voice break--the passionate despairing
cry for deliverance, for rest from the terror.

but there is no rest. the mountain slope is so that there is no standing
upon it, and once you stop, it breaks your heart to begin again. and so you
go on--up--up--and there is not any summit.

it is that way when you write a book; and that way when you make a
symphony; and that way when you wage a war.

       *       *       *       *       *

but my soul hungered for it. i have loved the great elemental
art-works--the art-works that were born of pure suffering. for months
before i began the captive i read but three books--read them and brooded
over them, all day and all night. they were prometheus bound, prometheus
unbound, and samson agonistes.

you sit with these books, and time and space "to nothingness do sink."
there looms up before you--like a bare mountain in its majesty--the great
elemental world-fact, the death-grapple of the will with circumstance.
you may build yourself any philosophy or any creed you please, but you
will never get away from the world-fact--the death-grapple of the soul
with circumstance. aschylus has one creed, and milton has another,
and shelley has a third; but always it is the death-grapple. chaos,
evil--circumstance--lies about you, binds you; and you grip it--you close
with it--all your days you toil with it, you shape it into systems, you
make it live and laugh and sing. and while you do that, there is in your
heart a thing that is joy and pain and terror mingled in one passion.

who knows that passion? who knows--

  "with travail and heavy sorrow
   the holy spirit of man."

prometheus bound, prometheus unbound, and samson agonistes! and now there
will be a fourth. it will be the captive.

am i a fool? i do not know--that is none of my business. it is my business
to do my best.

horace bids you, if you would make him weep, to weep first yourself. i
understand by the writing of a poem just this: that the problem you put
there you discover for yourself; that the form you put it in you invent
for yourself; and, finally, that what you make it, from the first word to
the last word, from the lowest moment to the highest moment, you _live_;
that when a character in such a place acts thus, he acts thus because you,
in that place--not would have acted thus, but _did_ act thus; that the
words which are spoken in that moment of emotion are spoken because you,

them. i propose that you search out the scenes that have stirred the hearts
of men in all times, and see if you can find one that was written thus--not
because the author had lived it thus, but because somebody else had lived
it thus, or because he wanted people to think he had lived it thus.

and now you are writing the captive. you do not go into the dungeon in the
body, because you need all your strength; but in the spirit you have gone
into the dungeon, and the door has clanged, and it is black night--the
world is gone forever. and there you sit, while the years roll by, and
you front the naked fact. six feet square of stone and an iron chain are
your portion--that is circumstance; and the will--_you_ are the will. and
you grip it--you close with it--all your days you toil with it; you shape
it into systems, make it live and laugh and sing. and while you do that
there is in your heart a thing that is joy and pain and terror mingled in
one passion.

it shall go forth into the world a living thing, a new well-spring of life.

it shall be--i don't know what you call the thing, but when you have hauled
your load halfway up the hill you put a block in the way to keep it from
sliding back. that same thing has to be done to society.

i was thinking to-day, that the captive would be an interesting document
to students of style. read it, and make up your mind about it; then i will
tell you--the first line of it is almost the first line of blank verse i
ever wrote in my life.

i have read about the french artists, the great masters of style, and
how they give ten years of their lives to writing things that are never
published. but i have noticed that when they are masters at last, and when
they do begin to publish--they very seldom have anything to say that i care
in the least to hear.

--my soul is centered upon _the thing_!

let it be a test.

       *       *       *       *       *

i am trying to be an artist; but i have never been able to study style. i
believe that the style of this great writer came from what he had to say.
you think about how he said it; but he thought about what he was saying.

it seemed strange to me when i thought of it. with all my trembling
eagerness, with all my preparation, such an idea as "practise" never came
to me. how could i cut the path until i had come to the forest?

all my soul has been centered upon _living_. since this book first took
hold of me--eighteen months ago--i could not tell with what terrible
intensity i have lived it. they said to me, "you are a poet; why don't you
write verses for the magazines?" but i was not a writer of verses for the
magazines.

it has been a shrine that i have kept in the corner of my heart, and tended
there. i have never gone near it, except upon my knees. there were days
when i did not go near it at all, when i was weak, or distraught. but i
knew that every day i was closer to the task, that every day my heart was
more full of it. it was like wild music--it came to a climax that swept me
away in spite of myself.

to get the mastery of your soul, to hold it here, in your hands, at your
bidding, to consecrate your life to that, to watch and pray and toil for
that, to rouse yourself and goad yourself day and night for that; to
thrill with the memory of great consecrations, of heroic sufferings and
aspirations; to have the power of the stars in your heart, of nature, of
history and the soul of man; _that_ is your "practise."

it is true that my whole life has been a practise for the writing of
this book, that this book is the climax of my whole life. i have
toiled--learned--built up a mind--found a conviction; but i have never
written anything, or tried to write anything, to be published. i have said,
"wait; it is not time." and now it _is_ time. if there is anything of
use in all that i have done, it is in this book.

yes; and also it is a climax in another way. it is my goal and my
salvation.--ah, how i have toiled for it!

i saw my soul to-day. it was a bubble, blown large, palpitating, whirling
over a stormy sea; glorious with the rainbow hues it was, but perilous,
abandoned.--do you catch the _feeling_ of my soul?

something perilous--i do not much care what. a traveler scaling the
mountains, leaping upon dizzy heights; a gambler staking his fortune, his
freedom, his life--upon a cast!

i will tell you about it.

it began when i was fifteen. my great-uncle, my guardian, is a wholesale
grocer in chicago; he has a large palace and a large waistcoat.

"will you be a wholesale grocer?" said he.

"no," said i, "i will not."

i might have been a partner by this time, had i said yes, and had a palace
and a large waistcoat too.

"then what will you be?" asked the great-uncle.

"i will be a poet," said i.

"you mean you will be a loafer?" said he.

"yes," said i--disliking argument--"i will be a loafer."

and so i went away, and while i went i was thinking, far down in my soul.
and i said: "it must be everything or nothing; either i am a poet or i am
not. i will act as if i were; i will burn my bridges behind me. if i am, i
will win--for you can not kill a poet; and if i am not, i will die."

thus is it perilous.

i fight the fight with all my soul; i give every ounce of my strength, my
will, my hope, to the making of myself a poet. and when the time comes i
write my poem. then if i win, i win empires; and if i lose--

"you put all your eggs into one basket," some one once said to me.

"yes," i replied, "i put all my eggs into one basket--and then i carry the
basket myself."

now i have come to the last stage of the journey--the "one fight more, and
the last." and can i give any idea of what is back of me, to nerve me to
that fight? i will try to tell you.

for seven years i have borne poverty and meanness, sickness, heat,
cold, toil--that i might make myself an artist. the indignities, the
degradations--i could not tell them, if i spent all the time i have in
writing a journal. i have lived in garrets--among dirty people--vulgar
people--vile people; i have worn rags and unclean things; i have lived upon
bread and water and things that i have cooked myself; i have seen my time
and my strength wasted by a thousand hateful impertinences--i have been
driven half mad with pain and rage; i have gone without friends--i have
been hated by every one; i have worked at all kinds of vile drudgery--or
starved myself sick that i might avoid working.

but i have said, "i will be an artist!"

day and night i have dreamed it; day and night i have fought for it. i have
plotted and planned--i have plotted to save a minute. i have done menial
work that i might have my brain free--all the languages that i know i have
worked at at such times. i have calculated the cost of foods--i have lived
on a third of the pittance i earned, that i might save two-thirds of my
time. i once washed dishes in a filthy restaurant because that took only
two or three hours a day.

i have said, "i will be an artist! i will fix my eyes upon the goal; i
will watch and wait, and fight the fight day by day. and when at last i am
strong, and when my message is ripe, i will earn myself a free chance, and
then i will write a book. all the yearning, all the agony of this my life
i will put into it; every hour of trial, every burst of rage. i will make
it the hope of my life, i will write it with my blood--give every ounce of
strength that i have and every dollar that i own; and i will win--i will
win!

"so i will be free, and the horror will be over."

i have done that--i am doing that now. i mean to finish it if it kills
me.--

but i was sitting on the edge of the bed to-night, and the tears came into
my eyes and i whispered: "but oh, you must not ask me to do anymore! i can
not do any more! it will leave me broken!"

i am happy to-night; i am a little bit drunk.

to-day was one day in fifty. why should it be? sometimes i have but to
spread my wings to the wind. yesterday i might have torn my hair out, and
that glory would not have come to me. but to-day i was filled with it--it
lived in me and burned in me--i had but to go on and go on.

the captive! it was the burst of rage--the first glow in the ashes of
despair. i was walking up and down the room for an hour, thundering it to
myself. i have not gotten over the joy of it yet: _"thou in thy mailed
insolence!"_

i wonder if any one who reads those thirty lines will realize that they
meant eight hours of furious toil on my part!

it should be all there, and yet not a line to spare; compact, solid,
each phrase coming like a blow; and above all else, that it should be
inevitable! when you stand upon the height of your being, and behold the
thing with all your faculties--the thing and the phrase are one, and one to
all eternity.

i was looking at a literary journal to-day. oh, my soul, it frightens me!
all these libraries of books--who reads them, what are they for? and each
one of them a hope! and i am to leap over them all--i--i? i dare not think
about it.

i have been helpless to-day. i can not find what i want--i struggled for
hours, i wore myself out with struggling. and i have torn up what i wrote.

blank verse is such a--such a thing not to be spoken of! is there anything
worse, except it be a sonnet? how many miles of it are ground out every
day--sometimes that kind comes to me to mock me--i could have written a
whole poem full of it this afternoon. if there are two lines of that sort
in the captive, i'll burn it all.

an awful doubt came to me besides. somebody had sown it long ago, and it
sprouted to-day. "yes, but will it be _interesting_?"

heaven help me, how am i to know if it will be interesting? the question
made me shudder; i have never thought anything about making it
interesting--i've been trying to make it true. can it possibly be that the
ecstasy of one soul, the reality of one soul, the quivering, exulting life
of it--will not interest any other soul?

"how can you know that what you are doing is real, anyhow?" the devil would
plague me to death to-day. "but how many millions write poems and think
they are wonderful!"

would you like to know where i am, and how i am doing all these things?
i am in a lodging-house. i have one of three hall rooms in a kind of top
half-story. there is room for me to take four steps; so it is that i "walk
up and down" when i am excited. i have tried--i have not kept count of
how many places--and this is the quietest. the landlady's husband has a
carpenter shop down-stairs, but he is always drunk and doesn't work; it has
also been providentially arranged that the daughter, who sings, is sick for
some time. next door to me there is a man who plays the 'cello in a dance
hall until i know not what hour of the night. he keeps his 'cello at the
dance hall. next to him is a pale woman who sits and sews all day and
waits for her drunken husband to come home. in front there is some kind of
foolish girl who leaves her door open in the hope that i'll look in at her,
and a couple of inoffensive people not worth describing.

i get up--i never know the time in the morning; and sometimes i lie without
moving for hours--thinking--thinking. or sometimes i go out and roam around
the streets; or sit perfectly motionless, gazing at the wall. when it will
not come, i make it. i breakfast on bread and milk, and i eat bread and
milk at all hours of the day when i am hungry. for dinner i cook a piece of
meat on a little oil-stove, and for supper i eat bread and milk. the rest
of the time i am sitting on the floor by the window, writing; or perhaps
kneeling by the bed with my head buried in my arms, and thinking until the
room reels. when i am not doing that i wander around like a lost soul; i
can not think of anything else.--sometimes when i am tired and must rest, i
force myself to sit down and write some of this.

i have just forty dollars now. it costs me three dollars a week, not
including paper and typewriting. thus i have ten or twelve weeks in which
to finish the captive--that many and no more.

if i am not finished by that time it will kill me; to try to work and earn
money in the state that i am in just at present would turn me into a
maniac--i should kill some one, i know.

i am quivering with nervous tension--every faculty strained to breaking;
the buzz of a fly is a roar to me. i build up these towering castles of
emotion in my soul, castles that shimmer in the sunlight:

  banners yellow, glorious, golden!

and then something happens, and they fall upon me with the weight of
mountains.

       *       *       *       *       *

ten weeks! and yet it is not that which goads me most.

what goads me most is that i am a captive in a dungeon, and am fighting for
the life of my soul.

i shall win, i do not fear--the fountains of my being will not fail me. i
saw my soul a second time to-day; it was no longer the bubble, blown large,
palpitating. it was a bird resting upon a bough. the bough was tossed and
flung about by a tempest; and a chasm yawned below; but the bough held, and
the bird was master of its wings, and sang.

the name of the bough was faith.

i have read a great deal of historical romance, and a great deal of local
color fiction, and a great deal of original character-drawing--and i have
wished to get away from these things.

there is no local color, and no character-drawing, in the captive. you do
not know the name of the hero; you do not know how old he is, or of what
rank he is, at what period or in what land he lives. he is described but
once. he is "a man."

my philosophy is a philosophy of will. all virtue that i know is
conditioned upon freedom. the object of all thinking and doing, as i see
it, is to set men free.

there is the tyranny of kings--the tyranny of force; there is the tyranny
of priests--the tyranny of ignorance; there is the tyranny of society--the
tyranny of selfishness and indolence; and above all, and including all, and
causing all--there is the tyranny of self--the tyranny of sin, the tyranny
of the body. so it is that i see the world.

so it is that i see history; i can see nothing else in history. the tyranny
of kings and nobles, the tyranny of the mass and the inquisition, the
tyranny of battle and murder and crime--how was a man to live in those
ages?

how is a man to live in _this_ age? the tyranny of kings and of
priests is gone, and from the tyranny of industrialism the individual can
escape. but the lightning--is not that an inquisition? and if it comes
after you, will it not find out all your secrets? and the tyranny of
hurricane and shipwreck, of accident, disease, and death? any tyranny is
all tyranny, i say; and the existence of tyranny is its presence.

it is conceivable that some day the sovereign mind may shake off its
shackles, and the tyranny of matter be at an end. but that day is not yet;
and meanwhile, the thing existing, how shall a man be free? that has been
the matter of my deepest brooding.

this much i have learned:

the man may accept this life, if it please him, and its chances; but while
he does he can never be a soul. so long as he accepts this life and its
chances, he is the slave of tyranny. when the day comes that mind is
sovereign, i will give myself into the hands of this life. but meanwhile i
will know myself for what i am--a bubble upon the surface of a whirling
torrent, an insect borne aloft upon a flying wheel.

       *       *       *       *       *

it is by your will that you are free; by your will you are one with the
infinite freedom, by your will you are master of time and your fate, lord
of the stars and the endless ages, thinker of all truth, hearer of all
music, beholder of all beauty, doer of all righteousness. that is the truth
which i have brought out of my deepest brooding.

so long as your happiness is in anything about yourself--your wealth, or
your fame, or your life--you are not free. so long as your happiness is in
houses and lands, in sons and in daughters, you are not free. you give one
atom of your soul to these things at your own peril; for when your hour
comes you tear them from you, though they be as your eyes; and by your
_will_ you save your soul alive.

therefore i write the captive. i put aside childish things--i grip my hands
upon naked reality.

       *       *       *       *       *

there are nine characters in the captive: a tyrant, two slaves, six guests,
and a man. there are two scenes--a dungeon, and a banquet-hall.

a tyrant: i understand by a tyrant a man whose happiness is the unhappiness
of others. i read of the discoverers of mexico, and how they found a
pyramid of human skulls, raised as a monument; that has been to me, ever
since, the type of tyranny. the forms of tyranny vary through the ages, but
the principle is always the same; a tyrant is a man who is made great by
the toil and sorrow of others.

the slave also remains the same through all time; and likewise the guest.
the guest is the man who takes the world as he finds it, and likes a good
dinner. the population of society is made up of tyrants, slaves, and
guests.

the man is a character of my own imagining.

the first scene of the captive is the dungeon. when i was very young i was
in europe, and i was in a dungeon; i have never forgotten it. there enter
the tyrant and the two slaves with the man. they chain him to the wall, and
then the tyrant speaks. that first speech--i have written it now--i have
gotten the hammer-thuds! tyranny is an iron thing--you had to feel the
tread of it, the words had to roll like thunder. it is an advantage to me
that i am full of wagner; i always hear the music with my poetry. (i shall
be disappointed if some one does not make an opera out of the captive.)

       *       *       *       *       *

the man is there, and he is there forever. after that, once a day, bread
and water are shoved in through an opening. but the door of the dungeon
does not open again until the last act--when ten years have passed.

       *       *       *       *       *

that is all. and now the man will battle with that problem. will he go mad
with despair? will he sink into a wild beast? will he commit suicide? or
what _will_ he do? day by day he sinks back from the question, numb with
agony; day by day the grim hand of fate drags him to it; and so, until from
the chaos of his soul he digs out, blow by blow, a faith.

here there will be reality; no shams and no lies will do here--here is iron
necessity, and cries out for iron truth. god--duty--will--virtue--let such
things no more be names, let us see what they _are_!

these are awful words. sometimes i shrink from this thing as from fire,
sometimes i rush to it with a song; i am writing about it now because i am
worn out, and yet i can not think of anything else.

this man will find the truth; being delivered from the captivity of the
world and set free to be a soul. superstition blinds him; doubt and despair
and weakness blind him; but still he gropes and strives, cries out and
battles for truth; until at last, shut up in his own being, he tears his
way out to the very source of it, and knows for himself what it is.
_infinite it is, and unthinkable; glorious, all-consuming, all-sufficing;
food and drink, friendship and love, ambition and victory, joy, power,
and eternity it is to him who finds it; and all things in this world are
nothing to him who finds it._

       *       *       *       *       *

and so comes the victory to this soul. hour by hour he catches gleams of
the light; day by day he toils toward it, with fear and agony and prayer;
until at last he knows his salvation--to rest never, and to toil always,
and to dwell in this presence of his god. in one desperate hour he flings
away the world and the hope of the world, and vows this consecration, and
lives.

       *       *       *       *       *

he keeps the vow; it is iron necessity that drives him. he finds himself,
he finds his way--each day his step is surer.

each day the channels of his being deepen. he lays broad plans for his
life--he gathers all knowledge, he solves all problems; lord of the
infinite mind, he ranges all existence, and beholds it as the symbol of
himself. into the deeps and yawning spaces of it he plunges; blind, he sees
what men have never seen; deaf, he hears what men have never heard--singer
he is, prophet and poet and maker. new worlds leap into being in the
infinite fulness of his heart, visions of endless glory that make his
senses reel; as a column of incense towering to the sky is the ecstasy of
his adoration and his joy.

       *       *       *       *       *

and so the long years roll by; and the unconquered spirit has left the
earth: left time and space and self, and dwells where never man has dwelt
before. and then one day the door of the dungeon is opened, and his chains
are shattered, and the slaves lead him up to the light of day.

it is the banquet-hall; and there is the tyrant, and there the
guests--there is the world.

       *       *       *       *       *

he is aged, and weak, and white, and terrible. they stare at him; and he
stares at them, for he is dazed. they begin to mock at him, and then at
last he realizes, and he covers his face and weeps--beholding the world,
and the way that it must come. they jeer at him, they strike him; and when
he answers not, they call to the slaves to torture him.

       *       *       *       *       *

this man has lived for ten years with _himself_. he is nothing but a
will. and now they will conquer him!

i recall the highest moment of my being. i saw that moment, and all the
others of my life. i saw them as something that i could not bear to see,
and i cried out that from that hour i would change them. i have not kept
the vow; there was no one to drive me.

but this man they drive; they pinch him and burn him and tear him; they
crush his limbs, they break his bones, they grind his flesh, they make his
brain a living fire of anguish. and he fights them.

into the deep recesses of his being goes the cry--for all that he has--for
all that he is! for every ounce of his strength, for every throb of his
will, for every vision, every truth that he knows! to bear this, to save
him here! and so he wrestles, so he rises, so he gropes and gasps; and in
the moment of his fiercest straining, with the throb of all his being he
bursts the barrier, he rends the veil; and infinite passion rolls in in
floods upon him, he clutches all existence in his arms; and from his lips
there bursts a mad frenzied shout of rapture--that makes his torturers
stand transfixed, listening, trembling with terror.

and so they drag him back to his dungeon; and there, unable to move, he
lies upon the stones and pants out his ecstasy and his life.

that is the captive.

what counts in this thing is momentum--spiritual momentum. you are filled
with it all the time, it never leaves you; it drives behind you like a gale
of wind; it roars in your ears when you are awake, it rocks you to sleep
when you are weary; whenever you are dull or do not heed it, it nags at
you, it goads you, it beats into your face. each day it is more, each day
it is harder, more unattainable; but only do not stop, it carries you with
it like a wave; you mount upon each day's achievement to reach the next,
you move with the power of all the days before. it is momentum that counts.

it is weak of me, but sometimes i can not help but look ahead--and think
that it is done! i could not find any words to tell the joy that that will
be to me--to be free, after so long--to be free!

i do not care anything about the fame--it would not be anything to me to be
a great author. if it could be done, nothing would please me better than
to publish it anonymously--to let no one ever know that it was mine. if i
could only have the little that i need to be free, i would publish all that
i might ever write anonymously.

yes, that is the thing that makes my blood bound. to be free! let it only
be done--let it only be real, as it will be--and the naked force of it will
shake men to the depths of their souls. i could not write it, if i did not

tunes! and he has two friends in there--i listen to their wit between the

here i sit, like a wild beast pent in a cage. i tell you i can bear any
work in the world, but i can not bear things such as this. that i, who am
seeking a new faith for men--who am writing, or trying to write, what will
mean new life to millions--should have my soul ripped into pieces by such
loathsome, insulting indignities!

hear him coming up the steps--and wait for him to begin this! i tell you,

i was crouching out on one of the docks last night. i had no place else to

the drunken man swearing at his wife; the boys screaming in the street and
kicking a tomato-can about. when i think of how much beauty and power has
been shattered in my life by such things as these, it brings tears of

a dreadful thing is unbelief! a dreadful thing it is to be an infidel!

--that is what all men cry nowadays--there is so much infidelity in the
world--it is the curse of our modern society--it is everywhere--it is
all-prevailing!

i had a strange experience to-day, sunday. i went into a church, and high
up by the altar, dressed in solemn garb and offering prayers to god--i saw
an infidel!

he preached a sermon. the theme of his sermon was "liberalism."

"these men," cried the preacher, "are blinding our eyes to our salvation,
they are undermining, day by day, our faith! they tell us that the sacred
word of god is 'literature'! and they show us more 'literature'; but oh, my
friends, what new _bible_ have they shown us!"

as i got up and went out of that church, i whispered: "what a dreadful
thing it is to be an infidel!"

oh dante and goethe and shakespeare--oh wordsworth and shelley and emerson!
oh thrice-anointed and holy spirits! what a dreadful thing it is to be an
infidel!

what a dreadful thing it is to believe in a bible, and not to believe in
literature--to believe in a bible and not to believe in a god!

you think that this world lives upon the revelation of two thousand years
ago! fool--this world lives as your body lives by the beating of its
heart--upon the revelation and the effort of each instant of its life. and
to-day or to-morrow the great revealer might send to some lonely thinker in
his garret a new word that would scatter to dust and ashes all laws and all
duties that now are known to men.

there are many ways to look at the world, and always a deeper one. i see it
as a fearful thing, towering, expanding, upheld by the toil and the agony
of millions. who will bring us the new hope, the new song of courage, that
it go not down into the dust to-day?

to do that there is the poet; to live and to die unheeded, and to feed for
ages upon ages the hungry souls of men--that is to be a poet. therefore
will he sing, and sing ever, and die in the sweetness of his song.

when i think of that--not now as i write it here in bare words--but in
quivering reality, it is a hand upon my forehead, and a presence in the

chiefest of all i think of my country! passionately, more than words can
utter, i love this land of mine. if i tear my heart till it bleeds and pour
out the tears of my spirit, it is for this consecration and this hope--it
is for this land of washington and lincoln. there never was any land like
it--there may never be any like it again; and freedom watches from her
mountains, trembling.

--it is a song that it needs, a song and a singer; to point it to its high
design, to thrill it with the music of its message, to shake the heart of
every man in it, and make him burn and dare! for the first time there is
liberty; for the first time there is truth, and no shams and no lies,
enthroned. the news of it has gone forth like the sound of thunder, and has
shaken all the earth: that man at last may live, may do what he can and
will!

--and to what is it? is it to the heaping up of ugly cities, the packing of
pork and the gathering of gold? that is the thing that i toil for--to tear
this land from the grasp of mean men and of merchants! to take the souls
of my countrymen into the high mountains with me, to thrill them with a
soaring, strong resolve! _living things_ shall come from this land of
mine, living things before i die, for the hunger of it burns me, and will
not ever let me rest. freedom! freedom! and stern justice and honor, and
knowledge and power, and a noonday blaze of light!

  arise in thy majesty, confronting the ages!
  stretch out thine arms to the millions that shall be!
  justice thine inheritance, god thy stay and sustenance,

i have been for two days in the mire. i was disturbed, and then i was
sluggish. oh, the sluggishness of my nature!

if ever i am a great poet, i will have made myself that by the power of my
will; that is a fact. i am by nature a great clod--i feel nothing, i care
about nothing. i look at the flowers as a cow chewing its cud.--it is only
that i _will_ to do right.

sometimes the sight of my dulness drives me wild. then again i merely
gaze at it. i try time and again to get my mind on my work, and
something--anything, provided it is trivial enough--turns me aside. just
now i saw a spider-web, and that made me think of bruce, and thence i went
by way of walter scott to palestine, and when i came to i was writing a
song for--who was the minstrel?--to sing outside of the prison of coeur de
lion.

i go wandering that way--sometimes i sit so for an hour; and then suddenly
i leap up with a cry. but i may try all i please--i don't care anything
about the work--it doesn't stir me--the verses i think of make me sick. and
then i remember that i have only so many weeks more; and what it will mean
to fail; and that makes me desperate, but doesn't help.

when i have stopped at some resting-place in the poem, i can get going
again. but now i have stopped in the middle of a climax; and the number
of times that i have read that last line, trying to find another--great
heavens!

but i can not find another word. i am in despair.

i know perfectly well what i shall do, only i am a coward, and do not do
it. i shall stay in this state till my rage has heaped itself up enough and
breaks through everything at last. and then i shall begin to hammer myself!
to swear at myself in a way that would make a longshoreman turn white. and
i shall spend perhaps two or three hours--perhaps two or three days--doing
that, until i am quite in a white heat; and then--i shall go to my work.

i said to myself the day before yesterday--with a kind of a dry sob--"i
can't do it! i can't do it!"

oh how tormented i am by noises--noises! what am i not tormented by? some
days ago i was writing in a frenzy--and the landlady came for her rent. and
the horrible creature standing there, talking at me! "so lonely!--don't
ever see people! mrs. smithers was a-saying--" oh, damn mrs. smithers!

i thought i could never do it--i was really about to give it up. i went out
on the street--i roamed about for hours, talking i don't know what nonsense
to myself. and then at last i came home, and i knelt down there at the
bedside and said: "here you stay without anything to eat until you've
written ten lines of that poem!"

and that was how i did it. i stayed there, and i prayed. i don't often
pray, but that time i prayed like one possessed--i was so lonely and so
helpless--and the work was so beautiful. i stayed there for nine blessed
hours, and then the clock stopped and i couldn't count after that.

but the day came, and then the ten lines! and so i had my breakfast.

i have been working with a kind of wild desperation all day to-day. oh it
hurts--it hurts--but i am doing it! whenever i read some lines of it that
are real--whenever some great living phrase flashes over me--then i laugh
like a man in the midst of a battle.

i shall be just as a man who has been through a battle; haggard and wild
and desperate. oh, i don't think i shall _ever_ have the courage to do
it again!

i did not know what it meant! i did not! it was giving myself into the
hands of a fiend!

shakespeare write thus with the blood of his soul? or am i weak? did he

heaven--i could see anything, dare anything, do anything. it made no
difference how hard--it called to me--on--on! and i said: "suppose i were

throbbing in it--i stood still in fear, it felt so as if something were
going to burst--my head seemed to weigh a ton. i poured cold water over it,

meantime i was happy!--think of a poet's being happy with city flowers! of
a poet's being happy with store-flowers--prostitute-flowers--flowers for
sale!

it was all about a narcissus--"very flower of youth, and morning's golden
hour!"--as i called it once. and it danced so! (it was out on the
curbstone)--and i went off happy.

then i thought of a poem that is pure distilled ecstasy to my spirit. i
will write it, and be happy again:

  sit thee by the ingle, when
  the sear faggot blazes bright;
  spirit of a winter's night!-- ...
  sit thee there, and send abroad,
  with a mind self-overaw'd,
  fancy, high-commission'd:--send her!
  she has vassals to attend her;
  she will bring, in spite of frost,
  beauties that the earth hath lost;
  she will bring thee, all together,
  all delights of summer weather;
  all the buds and bells of may,
  from dewy sward or thorny spray;
  all the heaped autumn's wealth,
  with a still, mysterious stealth;
  she will mix those pleasures up,
  like three fit wines in a cup,
  and thou shall quaff it!--

ah! and so i went along, "sun, moon, and stars forgot"--laughing and half
dancing. people stared at me--and i laughed. and then i passed three pretty
girls, and i laughed, and they laughed too. i guess they thought i was
going to follow them.

i often think how i shall spend my money after the captive is done. i shall
take a band of chosen youths, seekers and worshipers, and we shall build a
house on a mountain-top and worship the lord in the beauty of music!

i shall have to begin at the beginning--i have never had any one to teach
me music. but oh, if i did know!--and if i ever got hold of an
orchestra--_how_ i would make it go!

and in the middle of it the astonished orchestra would see the conductor
take wings unto himself and fly off through the roof.

a book that i mean to write some day will be called the pleasures of music,
and it will sing the joys of being clean and strong, of cold water and the
early morning and a free heart. it will show how all the unhappiness of men
is that they live in the body and in self, and how the world is to be saved
through music, which is not of the body, nor of self--which is free and
infinite, swift as the winds, vast as the oceans, endless as time, and
happy as whole meadows of flowers! the more who come to partake of it, the
better it is; for generous is "frau musika," her heart is made wholly of
love.

of his life. an artist, as i understand the word, is a man who has but one
joy and one purpose and one interest in life--the creating of beauty; he is
a man lifted above and set apart from all other motives of men; a man who
seeks not wealth nor comfort nor fame, nor values these things at all; a
man whose heart is forever lonely, whose life is an endless sorrow, and
whose excuse and whose spur and whose goal and whose consecration, is the
creating of beauty.

what power--be it talent or genius--god has given me, i can not tell; i
only know that an artist in that sense of the word i mean to be. i have
thought out a plan by which i shall make the publishing of my books, as
well as the writing of them, a thing of art.

no one will read very far in what i shall write without perceiving there
a savage hatred of the spirit of the modern world of wealth; it is only
because i have faith in democracy and hope in the people of my country that
i do not go to worship my god on a desert island. the world which i see
about me at the present moment--the world of politics, of business, of
society--seems to me a thing demoniac in its hideousness; a world gone mad
with pride and selfish lust; a world of wild beasts writhing and grappling
in a pit.

i am but a voice crying in the wilderness, and these things must run their
course. but in the meantime there is one thing that i can do, and the doing
of that has become with me a passion--i can keep my own life pure; i can
see that there is one man amid all this madness whose life is untouched by
any stain of it; who lives not by bread alone, nor by jewelry and gold; who
lives not to be stared at and made drunk with pride, but to behold beauty
and dwell in love; who labors day and night to keep a heart full of worship
and to sing of faith to suffering men; who takes of the reward of that
singing just what food and shelter his body needs; and who shrinks from
wealth and luxury as he would from the mouth of hell.

to live humbly and in oblivion would be my choice, but it will be my duty
to do differently. i know enough about the human heart to know that the
presence of one righteous man makes ten thousand unrighteous men angry and
uncomfortable. and therefore, for the help of any whom it may comfort, and
for the damnation of all the rest, i shall choose that the life i live and
the thing i do shall be public; i shall choose that the millions in our
country who are wearing out their frantic lives in the pursuit of the
dollar, and the few who are squandering their treasures in drunken pomp,
shall know that there is one man who laughs at them--whom all the millions
of all of them could not buy--and who dwells in joy and worship in a heaven
of which they can not even know. in other words, it is my idea not merely
to make a poem of my life, but to publish the poem.

i shall have other, and deeper, and kinder reasons also, for what i shall
do. what i write in my books must be from my deepest heart, the confession
of those moments of which i would speak to no living soul; it must be all
my tenderness, and all my rapture, and all my prayer; and do you think it
will come easily to me to put that out before the rough world to be stared
at, to be bound up in a book and hawked about by commercial people?...

would it not be interesting to me, if i could but pierce the future once,
and see how long it is destined to be before i do so publish a book! i
would do my work better, i fancy, for that.--but let it lie. i shall
publish it some day surely, that i know at least.

line by line, page by page, i do it. i am counting the days now,
wondering--longing.

it is not merely the writing of it, it is the seeing of it--the planning
and designing. sometimes i brood over it for hours--i can not find what
i want; and then suddenly a phrase flashes over me and like a train of
gunpowder my thought goes running on--leaping, flying; and then the whole
thing is plain as day. and i hold it all living in my hands.

i am blessed with a good memory. in times of excitement such as that i
seize all the best phrases and carry them away, and bury them out of sight,
like a miser. they are my nuggets of gold.

and sometimes i am a greedy miser, and stand perplexed; shall i go on and
gather more, or shall i make off with the armful that i have?

my religion is my art. i have no prayer but my work.

sometimes that is a glory, and sometimes again that is an agony. to have no
duty outside of yourself; to have no inspiration outside of yourself; to
have no routine to help you, no voice to cry out when your conscience goes
to sleep, no place of refuge in your weakness!--

all that is but the reason why i dare not be weak. i have chosen to lead
and not to follow; therefore i have no rest, and may not look behind me,
and can think of nothing but the way.

to be the maker of a religion is to sweat blood in the night-time.

there is but one way that i may live--to take every impulse that comes--to
be watching, watching--to dare always and instantly, to hesitate, to put
off never, to seize the skirt of my muse whenever it shimmers before me. so
i make myself a habit, a routine, a discipline; and so each day i have new
power. so each day i feel myself, i bare my arms, i walk erect, exulting--i
laugh--i am a god!

--and as i write that a feeling takes rise in me, and my heart beats
faster; but i am tired, i sink back, i do not take the gift that is
offered; and then my conscience gives a growl, and in a flash i see what
i have done, and feel a throb of rage and leap up.

one of my perils is that when i am strong i feel that i must always be so.

there to fear for them, to write them now?--and so they are never written.

insight, i understood an age--whole centuries of time, whole nations of
men.

i had been writing one of the great hymns, one of the great victories; and
i had been drunk with it, it had come with a surge and a sweep, it had set
everything about me in motion--huge phantom shapes--all life and all being
gone mad.

and then, when i had written it, i went out into the dark night; i walked
and walked, not knowing where, still tingling with excitement. and,
suddenly, i stood spellbound--the cathedral!

there it was--there it was! i saw it, alive and real before me--all of

of them--a woman--was singing.

o god, what a voice! so rich, so exquisite! it soared upward and died
again, quivering like the reflection of the stars on the water. it went
in--in to the very depths of my soul; it loosed all the woe of my spirit,
it made the tears gush into my eyes. and then it died away, away in the
distance; and i sat with my hands clasped.

recite about santa claus--"ho, castor! ho, pollux!"--and then ho a lot of
other things--a donner and a blitzen i remember in particular. i want a
reindeer--a pegasus--a valkyrie--an anything--to carry me away up into the

i managed to get him started at last. and now, oh just look at me! i've

after all.

the infinite relief that it is! the infinite exultation that it is! and
all to myself--not a soul near me! and out in the woods! _and mine for
a month!_ oh blessed 'cello player that moved away; blessed landlady's
sister that talked--!

the "cook-house" is about ten feet square. it is about one-third stove, now
covered with a newspaper and serving as a table. besides that there is one
chair, for which i have just improvised a leg, with the help of my knife.

besides the knife i have a fork, a plate, a cup, and a spoon--borrowed from
the farmer. i have a blanket and a bed consisting of an old carriage robe,
rented from the farmer. i have a lamp and a kerosene-can--ditto. i have a
frying-pan--ditto. but i haven't my little oil-stove, so i fear i shall eat
mostly cold things. i have a pail of milk, a loaf of bread, a ginger-cake,
some butter, some eggs, some bacon, some apples and some radishes; also a
tooth-brush, a comb, a change of clothing, two handkerchiefs, some pencils
and paper, prometheus bound, prometheus unbound, samson agonistes, faith,
hope, and charity!

my list of necessaries! i fear it will be inconvenient on rainy days. i am
like a child with a new toy, in my wonderful home. i was too excited to
think of working. i fried an egg over a little fire, and then i roamed all
about the woods. i don't remember ever having been so happy before. i had

it will be a fine big house--it will cost about fifty dollars; and there
will be a table and a chair, and a cot, and such things. it will stand by a
lake, a wild lake far out in the mountains! i have vowed to find a lake at

i have done nothing for two days but wander around and stare at things. it
is all gone, every gleam of it! and i can not bring it back--i know not
what to do, where to turn. i stopped in one of the hardest parts of the
whole thing--in the very midst of it; and how in the world am i to begin? i
walk around, i sit down, i get up again; i try to put my thoughts upon it,
i bring them back again and again. but i can not do it--i have let every
thread of it go. what has tramping over the country and delight in houses
got to do with my work?

i have nothing to write--the whole thing is a blank to me. and here i am,
eating up my provisions!--this shows me what i am--what a child.

the first step toward those fearful heights again? i cry that all day!

it is better than an orchestra. to be able to stretch your arms! to have a
place to walk! to be able to talk aloud!--to laugh--to shout--to do what
you please!--to be free from all men, and the thought of all men!

and to hear your own poetry aloud!--i cried out to-day that i would go back
and do the whole of the captive over again, so that i could hear it out
loud. it made me quite wild yesterday when i first realized that i was
_alone_!

wind roared in the trees--and i roared too!

i ate a raw egg this morning. for yesterday i let the fire go out five
times, and gave up my breakfast rather than start a sixth.

i wanted to save time--i thought it would be egg just the same; but i
record it for future generations of poets, that the experiment is not a
success. you taste raw egg all day.

i shall have them all hard-boiled in the farmhouse after this.

down.

i have worn a path in the woods, deep and wide, pacing back and forth,
back and forth, all day. any one who saw me would think that i was mad.
fighting--fighting--all the time fighting! sometimes i run--sometimes i
don't know what i do. last night i know that it grew dark, and that i was
still lying flat on the dead leaves, striking my hands, that were numb with
excitement. i was too weak to move--but i remember panting out, "there is
nothing like that in _king lear_!"

there is a man alive to read them!

to-day you may imagine me frantically throwing stones at a squirrel. i
said: "if i get him i won't have to go to the farmhouse to-morrow."

i had had nothing to eat but bread and apples for two meals, and i couldn't
stand that again.

i had fried squirrel and fried apples for supper. it was a very curious
repast.

and i was hungry, and i ate too much! that made me wild, of course, and i
flung all my apples away into the woods. may they feed new squirrels!

laughter--nothing frightens me now. i never knew what was the matter with
me before--it was simply that i could not fight as i chose. if ever i go
back again to have my soul pent up in the cities of men!

i am full of it--full of it! i grapple with it all the day, i can not get
enough of it. i do crazy things.

i asked to see the manager. i told him i had a manuscript to submit. he
looked at me--i guess i must look rather seedy. "what sort of a
manuscript?" he asked. "a blank verse drama!"

then he took it and glanced over it. "blank verse dramas are difficult
things to publish," he said.

"you had best read it, i think," i answered, "you will find it worth
while."

"very well, if you wish," said he, "we always read everything that is
offered to us."

society have asked me to their tea-parties. but there are one or two men in
this world that i should like to know. perhaps as the author of a book that
is known it would be possible.

the horror of that awful "eating-joint" grows on me every hour. i could not
bear it much more--physically it makes me ill, and no amount of enthusiasm
can make that better. i will not sell a second more of my time than i have
to. i made up my mind that i would give up the place at the end of the
week. the money will do me for another week after that, and by that time i
will surely have heard from the publishers.

i treated myself to a long holiday this afternoon. i went up to the park,
and walked and walked. everything was in a tumult within me--i was clear
of that last prison. and all the excitement and the power of that poem are
still in me. i am restless, all on fire, stern, hungry, like a wind-storm.
come not near me unless you wish for truth! come not near me if you fear
the gods!

to-day my thoughts went surging into the future. i shall have money!--i
shall be free!--and what shall i do next? i counted up what i might
have--even a slight success for the book would mean a fortune such as
turned my head to think of. what would i do?

my mind pounced upon a new work--a work that i have dreamed of often. would
it be my next work? i thought--would i be able--would i dare? it is a grand
thing.

i went on, and got to thinking of it; i almost forgot that i was not still
in the woods. what a sweeping thing i see it!

the american! it would have to be a three-volume novel, i fear--it would be
as huge as les miserables!

it is the civil war! i am haunted by that fearful struggle. is there
anything more fearful in history, any more tremendous effort of the human
spirit? and so far it has not made one great poem, one great drama, one
great novel!

       *       *       *       *       *

it was the furnace-fire in which this land was forged--this land which
holds in its womb the future of the world--this land that is to give laws
to the nations and teach mankind its destiny. i search the ages, and i find
no struggle so fraught with meaning, with the woe and the terror and the
agony of a desperate hope.

it must be all put into an art-work, i say! there is no theme that could
thrill the men of this country more, that could lift them more, that could
do more to make their hearts throb with pride. we sent all the best that we
had--armies and armies of them--and they toiled and suffered, they rotted
upon a thousand fields of horror. and their souls cry out to me, that it
must not be for naught, that the fearful consecration must not be for
naught.

the world is filled with historical fiction; it is the cant and the sham of
the hour.--bah!

       *       *       *       *       *

--this is what i long to do; to take the agony of that struggle and live it
and forge it into an art-work; to put upon a canvas the soul of it; to put
it there, living and terrible, that the men of this land might know the
heritage that is come down to them.

it would take years of toil, it would take money, too--i should have to go
down there. but some day i shall do it!

i saw some of it to-day, and it made my blood go!

i saw a poet, young, sensitive, throbbing at the old, old wrong, at the
black shame of our history; i saw him drawn into that fearful whirlpool of
blood and passion, driven mad with the pain and the horror of it; and i saw
him drilled and hammered to a grim savageness, saw him fighting, day by
day, with his spirit, forging it into an iron sword of war. he was haggard
and hollow-eyed, hard, ruthless, desperate. he saw into the future, he saw
the land he loved, the land he dreamed of--the union! she stretched out her
arms to him; she cried with the voices of unborn ages, she wrung her hands
in the agony of her despair. and for her his heart beat, for her he was
a madman, for her he marched in sun and in snow, for her he was torn and
slashed, for her he waded through fields of slaughter. of her he dreamed
and sung--sung to the camps in the night-time, till armies were thrilled
with his singing.

       *       *       *       *       *

this was the thing of which he sang, the gaunt, grim poet: there is a
monster, huge beyond thought, terrible, all-destroying; the name of it is
rebellion, and the end of it is death! day by day you grapple with it, day
by day you hammer it, day by day you crush it. down with it, down with it!
finish it!

i heard that as a battle-cry: "finish it!" i saw a man, wild and
war-frenzied, riding a war-frenzied horse; he rode at the head of a
squadron, bare-headed, sword in hand, demon-like--thundering down-hill upon
a mass of men, stabbing, slashing, trampling, scattering! above the roar of
it all i heard his cry: "finish it! finish it!"

and afterward he staggered from his horse and knelt by the men he had
killed, and wept.

       *       *       *       *       *

--i saw him again. it was when the man of the hour had come at last;
when the monster had met his master; when, day by day, they hammered it,
the fire-spitting, death-dealing monster; when they closed with it in
death-grapple in a tangled wilderness, where armies fought like demons in
the dark, and the wounded were burned by the thousands. i saw companies of
fainting, starving, agonized men, retreating, still battling, day by day;
and i saw the wild horseman galloping on their track, slashing,
trampling--and still with the battle-yell: "finish it! finish it!"

       *       *       *       *       *

i saw him yet a third time. it was done, it was finished; and he lay
wounded in a dark room, listening. outside in the streets of washington
a great endless army marched by, the army of victory, of salvation; and
the old war-flags waved, and the old war-songs echoed, and he heard the
trampling of ten thousand feet--the rumbling of the old cannon--and the
ocean-roaring of the vast throngs of men! a wild delirium of victory
throbbed in his soul,--burned him up, as he lay there alone, dying of his
passion and his wounds. born of the joy that throbbed in the air about him,
born of the waving banners and the clashing trumpets and the trampling
hosts and the shouting millions--a figure loomed up before him--a figure
with eyes of flame and a form that towered like the mountains--with arms
outstretched in rapture and robes that touched the corn-fields as she
sped--angel, prophetess, goddess!--liberty!

my wildest moment.

nervous, impatient--it is so that i have lived. never to waste an instant
has been my passion. i have struggled, watched, fought for a minute. if
ever i were held back or kept idle it drove me wild, and i burst through
everything. it has always been a torture to me not to be thinking
something.

but less of that torture than i have now, i think i never had; it seems as
if i had won the mastery--i mind nothing any more. i walk upon the air,

asking; nothing disturbs me, nothing hinders me--i take everything along

which we could engage with profit. at the same time, however, we have been

i begged off from work for an hour. i have had an interview with the great
publishers! i have learned a great deal too.

i saw the manager of the firm. he meant to be very kind, that is the first
thing to say; the second is that he is very well-dressed, and
comfortable-looking.

       *       *       *       *       *

"now, mr. stirling," said he, "you know a publishing house is always on
the lookout for the new man. that is why i wanted to have the pleasure of
meeting you. it is evident to me that you have literary talent of no common
kind."

(i bow.)

"i wish that i could tell you that we could consider the captive an
available piece of writing; i have read it myself with the greatest care.
but you must know, mr. stirling, that it is an exceedingly _difficult_
piece of work; i mean difficult from a publisher's point of view. there is
very little demand for poetry nowadays--a publisher generally brings out at
a loss even the poems that make a reputation for their authors. whether you
are aware of that i don't know, but it is true; and i think of all kinds of
poetry a blank verse tragedy is the most to be shunned."

(here a pause. i have never any tongue when i am with men.)

"what i want to talk to you about, mr. stirling, is the work which you
contemplate in the future. as i said, i was interested at once in this
work; i should like very much indeed to advise you and to be of any
assistance to you that i can. i should like very much to know what your
plans are. i should like very much to see anything that you might write.
are you contemplating anything just at present?"

"no, not just at present."

"not? don't you think that you might find it possible to produce something
just a little more in accordance with the public taste? don't you think,
for instance, that you might possibly write a novel?"

(some hesitation.) "i have thought of a novel."

"ah! and might i ask--would it be a character study?--or perhaps
historical?--or--"

"it would be historical."

"ah! and of what period?"

"the civil war."

(a great look of satisfaction.) "dear me! why, that is very interesting
indeed, mr. stirling! i should like to see such a work from your pen. and
are you thinking of completing it soon?"

(general discomfort on my part.) "i had never thought of the time exactly.
i had feared it would take a great many years."

(perplexity.) "oh, pshaw!--still, of course, that is the way all great work
is done. yes, one has to obey one's own inspiration. i understand perfectly
how he can not adjust himself to the market. i have seen too often how
disastrous such attempts are."

(more courteous platitudes, i assenting. then at last, weary--)

"you don't think, then, that you will be able to undertake the captive?"

"no, mr. stirling, i really do not think we can. you understand, of course,
if i take this work to the firm i have to tell them i think it will sell;
and that i can not honestly do. you know that a publishing house is just as
much limited as any other business firm--it can not afford to publish books
that the trade does not want. and this is an especially unusual sort of
thing, it is by no means easy to appreciate--you must be aware of that
yourself, mr. stirling. you see when i read a manuscript i have to keep
constantly before my mind the thought of how it is going to affect the
public--a very different thing from my own judgment, of course. from the
former standpoint i believe there are things in the captive that would meet
with a reception not satisfactory to either of us, mr. stirling."

(perplexity on my part.) "you'll have to explain that to me, i fear."

"why--but the explaining of that would be to offer you my opinion about the
book--"

"i should be very pleased to hear it. your reason for declining it, then,
is not altogether that it is a blank-verse drama?"

"not altogether, mr. stirling. it's a little difficult for me to tell you
about these things, you know. i understand that the book must have meant a
great deal to you, and so i am naturally diffident. but if you will pardon
my saying so, it seems to me that the book--it is obviously, of course,
the work of a young man--it is very emotional, it strives to very high
altitudes. i will not say that it is exaggerated, but--the last part
particularly--it seems to me that you are writing in too high a key, that
your voice is strained." (an uncomfortable pause.) "of course, now, that is
but my opinion. it will not seem of any value to you, perhaps, but while
i read it i could not get away from the fact that it was not altogether
natural. it seemed hysterical and overwrought in places--it gives the
effect of crudeness. it is rather hard, you know, to expect a man who sits
at a desk all day to follow you in such very strenuous flights." (a slight
laugh.)

"mind you it is not that i do not appreciate high qualities, mr. stirling,
it is merely that it seemed to me that if it were toned down somewhat it
would be better--you know such things strike different people in different
ways; you do not find it easy to believe that it would affect men so--but i
am pretty sure that the impulse of the average critic would be to go still
further--to make fun of it. here, for instance--let me read you the opinion
upon the book that was handed in by one of our most experienced
readers--etc., etc.--"

i have told enough of that story, giving the conversation as literally as
i can recall it. i am always a fool, the presence of other men overawes
me; i sit meek and take all that comes, and then make my escape. the great
publishers' manager still thinks he impressed me with his wisdom--he has
half an idea i'm going to "tone down" the captive!

--he read me that criticism--great god, it makes me writhe! it was like a
review of the book of revelations by bill nye.

i sat last night brooding over this thing till almost dawn. i could not
bring myself to the thought of offering my work again to be judged by such
people. i made up my mind to take a different course--i sat and wrote a
long letter to a certain poet whom i love and honor. he is known as a
critic--he will know. i told him the whole story, and asked him to read the
poem.

it was something that i had never thought about, the effect of the captive
upon commonplace people. i was so full of my own rapture--i made my
audience out of my own fancy. and now these snuffy little men come peering
at it!

my appeal is not to the reading public--my appeal is to great minds and
heroic hearts--to the ages that will come when i have gone.

wander around, restless, unhappy. that horrible prison that i am pent

meanwhile that intolerable treadmill! it drives me wild! i am so full of
life, of passion; and to be dragged back--and back--and stamped on! each
day i feel myself weaker; each day my power and my joy are going. let me

me in my head.

i read the confessions of a young man, and i felt the vigor of it, and the

life are occasionally enunciated by commonplace people, and that gives an
opportunity to be startling. but i leave it for small boys to gape at such
fireworks; my interest is in the stars.

the last chapter runs into absolute brutality. i am accustomed to say that
gautier is a ruffian author, but if there is any ruffianism in gautier more
savage than that sentiment about the "skinful of champagne," i do not know
where to find it.

about such stuff as that i would say that it makes me sick, but it is not
worth that--it simply makes me tired. one would not call it impudent,
because it is so silly--it is the driveling of a fool. he will get me off
in a corner now, will he, and probe my soul? "out with it!--why not confess
that you'd like to live a life of dissipation if you only had the money!"
why, you poor fool, before i would live such a life, i'd have my eyes torn
out, and my ears torn off, and my fingers, and my hands, and my feet. "why
not confess the wild joys of getting drunk on champagne!" poor fool, i have

picture of musset the other day; it was a noble face--the face of a man;
and in the face of a man i read dignity and power--high things that i love
and bow before. here are lips,--and lips are things that speak of beauty;
here are eyes,--and eyes are things that seek the light. and now to gaze
upon that face and say: "this man lived in foulness; he was the slave of
hateful lust--he died rotten, and sodden with drink."--i say that i do not
find it easy.

sin--anything, one way or the other. if a man must still think about sin,
let him go back, and let him go down,--let him be a christian. let him
wrestle with his body, overcome himself, obey laws, and learn fear. to such
men and to such ways i can only say: "i have nothing to do with you." my
life is for free men--my words are for free men--for men defying law and
purged of fear, for men mad with righteousness. what right have foul men
in the temple of my muse? the thought of them is insult to me--away with
them--in their presence i will not speak of what i love. for i am a
drunkard--yes, and i am drunk all night and all day! and i am a lover--a
free lover--knowing no law and defying all restraint. and how can i say
such things in the presence of foul men?

let not any man think that he can feel the love-clasp of my muse while
he hides a satyr's body underneath his cloak. free is my muse, and bold,
fearing not the embrace of man, fearing not passion, nor the words of
passion,--not the throbbing heart, nor the burning brow, nor the choking
voice. but the warmth of her breath and the fire of her eyes, they were
kindled at a shrine of which the beast does not know. let not any man think
that he can kiss the lips of my muse while his breath is tainted with the
fumes of wine!

an artist is a man with one pleasure--and it is not self-indulgence; an
artist is a man with one virtue--and it is not self-restraint. sweetly and
simply will i and my muse take all temptation, knowing not that it tempts,
and wondering at the clamor of men. i will eat and drink that i may be
nourished, i will sleep that i may be rested, i will dress that i may be
warm. when i go among men it shall be to speak the truth, and when i press
a woman to my heart, it shall be that a man may be born into the world.
there is but one sin that i know, and that is dulness; there is but one
virtue, and that is fire. and for the rest, i love pleasure, and hold
it sweetest and holiest of all the words i know; the guide-post of all
righteousness is pleasure--which whoso learns to read may follow all his
days.

i have been forcing myself to read gibbon, but half of him was all i could

recital of facts, without the least interest or importance, and a recital
by the shallowest of men!

the vulgarity of his character is more evident than ever since the
repressed parts of his biography have appeared. it is comical. and this
man, who has no more understanding of spirituality than a cow, to tell the
story of the greatest movement of the soul of man in history!

there is not one gleam of the christian superstition left in me. i have
nothing to fear from the sneers of gibbon any more than i have from those

is it not the greatest? is there any story in history more sublime than the
story of this man? a humble, ignorant peasant he was, and out of the faith
of his soul he made the future of the world for centuries! it is a thing
that makes your brain reel.

i write it casually, but i have shuddered over it far into the deep, deep

every day--find out some place where there are not too many nurse-girls!

i can not begin any other book; i must stand or fall by the captive. i
shall be a "homo unius libri"!

but i can not attempt to write again--ever--in these circumstances. it is
not that my force is spent--i am only at the beginning of my life, i see
everything in the future. but i could not wrestle with these outside things

september 15th.

a slight preliminary, of course. i spent a ghastly day hunting for a room.
i found one in a sufficiently dirty and cheap place, and then i spent
another hour finding a man who would take my trunk for a quarter. having
succeeded in that, i walked up there to save five cents; and when the trunk
came the driver tried to charge me fifty cents!

picture me haggling and arguing on the steps--"didn't know it was so
far--man didn't understand"--god knows what else! and then he tries to
carry off the trunk--and i rushing behind, looking for a policeman! again
more arguing, and a crowd, of course. at last it appears that i have to pay
him what he asks and go down to the city hall and make my complaint--hadn't
told him how many steps there were, etc. so finally i agree to carry it up
the steps myself, if he'll only leave it for a quarter!

next you must picture me breaking my back and tearing my fingers and the
damned wall paper--while the damned frowsy-headed landlady yells and the
damned frowsy-headed boarders stick out their heads! and so in the end i
get into my steaming hot room and shut the door and fall down on the bed
and burst into tears.

o god, the stings of this bitter, haunting, horrible poverty! the ghastly
weight that has hung about my neck since ever i can remember! oh, shall i
ever be free from it? shall i ever know what it is to have what i ought
to have, to think of my work without the intrusion of these degrading
pettinesses?

they are so infinite, so endless, so hideous! the thing gets to be a habit
of my thoughts; my whole nature is steeped and soaked in it--in filthy
sordidness! i plot and i plan all the day--i can not buy a newspaper
without hesitating and debating--i am like a ragpicker going about the
streets!

sometimes the thing goads me so that i think i must go mad--when i think of
the time that i lose, of the power, of the courage! i walk miles when i am
exhausted, to save a car-fare! i wear ragged collars and chafe my neck! i
stand waiting in foul-smelling grocery shops with crowds of nasty people!
i cook what i eat in a half-dirty frying-pan because i can not afford to
pay the servant to wash it! so it is that i drag myself about--chafing and
goaded--crouching and cringing like a whipped cur!

and something clutches me in my heart! let me go! let me go!

six times in the course of my life, when i have been starved sick on my own
feeding, i have become a "table-boarder"; and out of those six experiences
i could make myself another zola. the infinite variety of animality in
those six vile stables--the champing jaws and the slobbering mouths and
the rank odor of food! the men who shoveled with their knives or plastered
things on their forks as hod-carriers do mortar! the women who sucked in
their soup, and the children who smeared their faces and licked their lips
and slopped upon the table-cloth! the fat dutchman who grunted when he ate,
and then leaned back and panted! the yellow woman with the false teeth who
gathered everything about her on the table! the flashy gentleman with the
diamond scarf-pin and the dirty cuffs, who made a tower out of his dirty
dishes and then sucked his teeth! o god!

this mud, and all in vain; i can still starve, but i can not eat what is
not clean.

the infamy of these things, and it will be a book that will make your flesh

i am on a four months' studying campaign. it is monotonous--to read about.
i get up at six, and when i have had my breakfast and fixed a lunch, i go
over into the park. there are only birds and squirrels and a few tramps

german, i read goethe and schiller, and moliere and hugo again.

now i am reading history; it gives me the nightmare, but one has to read
it.

every night when i put down my book, i flee in thought to my own land as to
a city of refuge. a history where everything counts! a history that is not
a mad, blind chaos of blood and horror! a history that has other meaning
than the drunken lust and the demon pride of a napoleon or a louis le
grand!

christian dispensation, and the second the american.

there is a great deal in knowing how to read, especially with such books

my mind. if he gets sluggish i am soon through with him--i read whole

the time when the captive is discussed in them. can i believe that this

i feel a new interest now in the authors that people talk about. i want
to know who they are and what they do. and all the time i find myself
thinking: "have i more than this man?--more than that man?" that always
throws me into despair, because i am a great admirer; and because i am
always hypnotized by the last thing that i read.

but i find very little that is great in modern books. books are better
made now than they ever were before--i mean in the way of literary
craftsmanship. as far as form goes, there is no author living who would put
together such a hodge-podge as wilhelm meister, or la nouvelle heloise. but
they all imitate each other; they are all mild and tame; there is no real
power, no genius among them. they have even forgotten it exists.

from the account of those who talk about it, genius appears to be the

out of the common for the astonishment and confusion of the rest of us
poor human beings. do they mean anything more or less than the mastery
which comes to any man in accordance with his powers and diligence in any
direction? if not, why not have an end to the superstition which has caused
our race to go on for so long writing and reading of the difference between
talent and genius?"

it not with the hunger to go on that i am mad?--you fool--do you think i
wrote to you because i wanted some one to admire me--because i had the need
of praise and encouragement in my work? give me a year's freedom--give me
two hundred dollars--and i'll show you how much i care for your praise.

but then you chain me here to your torture stake, and bid me "go on! go
on!"

--and it is in that struggle that i am to get my strength! that sentence
burns in my blood, it stings me! what is this struggle that you prate
about, anyway? and what do you mean by "getting my strength?" did i get my
strength to write the captive that day when those fishwives moved in next
door to me? did i get my strength to dream of my new work that day when i
was chasing after an express-driver to save a quarter? do i get it now when
i am sitting here panting and ill with a headache, and with despair, and
with lack of food? damn such asininity, i say!

what do you mean, i cry--what do you mean? would it have helped kant to
solve the problems of the universe to have had a swarm of mosquitoes
buzzing about his face? would it have helped beethoven to compose his
symphonies to have had a dance hall over his head? what ghastly farce
it is! that a poet is helped to realize his dreams and his joys in this
hellish, reeking, market-place of a city! why, i tell you, sir, that every
hour that i have lived in it i have known that i have paid out unmeasured
powers of my soul! and i know now, as every other poet knows, that when i
am out of it i come with what pittance of strength i have been able to save
from the horrible ordeal. do you think that i am a fool that i do not know
what inspires me and what degrades me? why, sir, i sit here and watch my
spirit wither like a frost-bitten plant!

i had an adventure to-day. i woke up with a headache, dull, sick,
discouraged. i cared no more about anything. i got out the captive and made
ready to take it to the publishers.

and then i thought i would read a little of it.

i sat down in the corner--i forgot the publishers--i sat
reading--reading--and my heart beat fast, and my hands shook, and all my
soul rose in one hymn of joy!

oh world, do your worst, i do not care! you may turn me off--but the gates
of heaven are open! i will go on--i will bear anything--bear all things! i
will wait and live and learn meanwhile, knowing with all my soul what this
book is and what it must bring. so long as i can read it, i can wake my
soul again.

weeks."

housetops. no other book--no future book--_this_ book! it is a great

it--wordsworth, our greatest, our noblest poet since milton. he had
his sacred inspiration, and the world laughed at it; and so, grimly,
systematically, he set to work to teach them--to say to all men--to say to
himself--to say day and night--"it _is_ poetry! it is _great_
poetry! it is--_it is_!"

and of course at last he made them believe him; and when they believed him,
he--wordsworth--was a matter-of-fact, self-centered, dull and poor old man.

i have a distant relative in this city, an old gentleman who belongs to
clubs and is what is known as a "man of the world." he has quite a sense
of humor--is famous for good stories. he told me that he was interested in
me--that he would be glad to find a place for me in life, if i would only
get over my youthful follies. it has been years since i saw him, but i can
still hear him.

the last words he ever said to me were these--said with his quiet, amused

me--just leave it to time, and it'll come out all right."

never have i sunk into a fit of despair that i have not thought of that;

trying to deceive yourself?"

"we have read with care the manuscript of the captive which you have
offered us. we are pleased to be able to tell you that we have found it
a very fine piece of work, but we are sorry to say that our previous
experience with publications of this character does not lead us to believe
that we could make a success of it.

"we are holding ms. subject to your order."

i did a desperate thing to-day--two of them. first i had to go and get the
manuscript, so i asked to see the publisher. i sat down and looked straight
into his face and said: "how is a man who is trying to write what is fine
to keep alive if the publishers won't publish what he writes?"

he was very kind--he seemed to be interested. he explained that a publisher
who published books that the public did not want would be driven out of
business in a year. then he said he knew many who were facing the same
problem as i; that there was nothing to do but write for the magazines and
the papers, and that it was a bitter shame that society made no provision
for such men. "your work is as noble and sincere as work can be," he said,
"but i do not believe that you will find a publisher in this country to
undertake it, unless there be one who feels wealthy enough to do it as a
service to literature and a labor of love."

       *       *       *       *       *

that made me turn white. i got my manuscript and i went out on the street,
and the houses reeled about me. "so," i said, "and that settles it!"

as i walked along i stared into the future. it seemed very clear all of a
sudden.

i thought it all out. "no one will publish the captive," i said, "and no
one would heed it if it were published. therefore i have but one question
to face, have i the strength to go on, living as i have lived, distracted
and tormented as i have been--and still piling up new emotions in my soul,
daring new efforts, reaching new heights, producing new books? i can have
no idea that my second work will be any more available than my first; on
the contrary, i know that it would be just what the captive is, only more
so. therefore, perhaps it will be ten years--perhaps it will be twenty
years--before men begin to pay any heed to what i have written! and so
there is the question, have i the strength to go on in that way--have i the
strength to face that future?"

then i grew faint and had to lean against a railing. _i knew that i could
not do that!_

it is no question of what i will do! it is a question of what i _can_
do! i am weakened and sick with the yearning that i have in me already. my
last "business" experience drove me mad. and i am to go on, i am to rouse
new hunger, new passion, new agony in my soul! why, the work that i have
dreamed of next is so hard and so far-away that i hardly dared even whisper
it! it would take years and years of toiling! and i am to do it here in
this seething city--to do it while i sell wholesale-paper--to do it while
i am sick for lack of food! i can not do it! i _can_ not!

i went home, and i was crazy; so it was that i did my second desperate
thing.

i sat down and wrote a letter to mr. ----. i wrote a letter--i can not
see how it could fail to stir the soul of any man. i told him how i had
toiled--i told him how for four long months i had waited in agony--i told
him what the publishers had said to me. i begged him--i implored him--for
the sake of the unuttered message that cried out day and night in my
soul--not to throw the letter aside--to read it--to give me a chance to
talk to him. i said: "i will live in a hut, i will cook my own food, i will
wear the clothes of a day laborer! if i can only be free--if i can only be
free to be an artist! i could do it, all of it, for two hundred dollars a
year; and i could win the battle, i know, if i had but three years. i am
desperate as i write to you--i look ahead and i can see only ruin; and not
ruin for myself--i do not mind that--but ruin for my art! i can tell you
what that means to me in but one way--i ask you to read my book. i have put
all my soul into that book--i will stake my all upon it. if you will only
read it, you will see what i mean--you will see why i have written you this
letter. you will see that it is not a beggar's letter, but a high challenge
from an artist's soul."

so there is one chance more. i do not see how he can refuse, and if he will
only read the manuscript, i will be safe, i think.

god's--and what have the rabble to do with it! and all its tenderness! all
its shrinking ecstasy! all its holiest consecration!--you will take them
out to sell them to the rabble!

the gallic disease is this: to see only one thing in life, to know only one

every thought, every phrase. to know that every character in a book is
thinking it; to know that every man who is introduced is looking for a
woman! and that as soon as he finds her, they must forthwith--whatever be
their age, rank, character, and position at the moment--begin to burn with
unclean desires!

that is what one might call the _convention_ of french fiction. it
gets very monotonous when you are used to it; it takes all of the interest
out of the story. for there is but one ending to such a story.

one's whole being is lowered by contact with that incessant animal appeal.

i have discovered another trouble--as if i did not have enough! i am to
suffer from indigestion! it plagues me continuously--i can not do anything
for an hour after a meal, no matter what simplest thing i have eaten.

and so all through my life i am to be hindered in my work by having to
wrestle with this handicap! just as if i had not been a clean man, but some

to-day i happened to read in one of the magazines an article on a literary
subject by a college professor of some reputation. it was a fine piece of
work, i thought, very true; and i got to thinking of him, wondering if
_he_ might not be the man.

i have no hope that these last publishers will take the book, and so i made
up my mind to write to him.

i wrote what i had written to all the others; i told him how i had
struggled, and how i was living. perhaps he is less busy than the rest.

"i reply to your letter somewhat against my rule--chiefly because of what
you tell me about your circumstances. i will read your manuscript if you
still think it worth while to send it to me; but i must tell you at the
outset that i consider the chances very unfavorable, as regards my finding
the work what you believe it. i assure you that the literary situation
is not in the least what you picture it; the book-market was never more
wide-awake than it is now, the publishers are all as eager as possible
for the least sign of new power; and besides that, the magazines afford
outlet--not only for talent, but for mediocrity as well. you are entirely
mistaken in your idea that literary excellence is not equivalent to
commercial availability. if you could write one paragraph as noble as the
average of dr. ----, or one stanza as excellent as the average of professor
----, you would find an instant and hearty welcome.

need. you will not make yourself a great artist by secluding yourself from
men--go out into the world, young man, go out into the world and see what
men are!

i had a strange adventure to-night, a long, long adventure. i was free for
once in my life! free and glorious--and delivered from earth! it happened
all in a dream; i sat crouching in the corner, thinking.

       *       *       *       *       *

i had been walking down the street during the day and had seen a flower in
a window, and had been made happy for a minute, thinking of last spring. my
step had grown light, and i had forgotten the street around me. but then i
had heard two little girls, sitting in a doorway, whisper excitedly: "oh,
look--he's laughing!" and instantly all my soul had shrunk up, and my dream
had fled, and i had hurried past and turned the corner.

       *       *       *       *       *

is it not a strange thing? i mused--this as i sat by the window--that deep
instinct of secrecy--that cowardice! why is it that i would die before i
would let any man see the life of my soul? what are these people to me?
i know them not at all, and never shall. but i crouch back--i put on a
mask--yes, think of it, i even _give_ up the life of my soul, rather
than that any man should see me acting differently than himself!

somehow all at once that thought took hold of me with an overwhelming
power--i saw the truth as i had never seen it before in my life. i saw how
we live in society; and how social convention and triviality have us in
such a grasp that it never even dawns upon us that the laws it dictates
are not eternal and necessary! "you must be dignified, and calm, and
commonplace," say social convention and triviality.

--but i am _not_ dignified--i am _not_ calm!--i am _not_
commonplace!

well, then, you must _seem_ so. you must walk quietly; you must gaze
around indifferently; you must keep a vacant face; you must try to look
innocent of a thought. if you can't manage that--if you really want to
think--why then you must flee away to the woods, where you are sure no one
will come upon you and find you out. and if you can't do that--why then
there's nothing for you to do but give up thinking, give up living, become
like everybody else!

       *       *       *       *       *

that idea shook me all of a sudden, it made me quite wild--it made me dig
my nails into my hands. it was the truth--i saw that--it was the truth!
here i was, a miserable, pining, starving wretch--and for no reason in
the world but that i was a coward, but that i was a coward--a blind fool!
because i had not let the empty-headed and sodden, the placid and smug,
the fat and greasy citizens of our great metropolis, tell _me_--the
servant of the muses--how i ought to look, how i ought to act, what i ought
to be! the very breath of my body is prayer--is effort--is vision; to dwell
in my own light, to behold my own soul, to know my own truth--that is my
one business in this world! to assert my own force--to be what i like--that
is my duty, that is my hope, my one hope in all the world! and i do not, i
can not, i dare not do it! i am sick and starved and dying, and i crouch
in corners while i pray for help, and if a gleam of sunshine comes from a
flower to me, it goes because a child sees me laughing!

i sat burning with the rage of that. what am i to do? i cried. how is it to
be changed? shall i live my life in spite of all men?

and then i heard one of my devils--my commonplace devil--say, "but people
would think you were crazy!"

"what do i care what people think?" i burst out.

then came another of my devils--my facetious devil--and he made me laugh.
"by all means," said he, "let us get together a few eager poets, and
establish a society for the propagation of lunacy. let us break down these
conventions and confound the eyes of the fat and greasy citizens, and win
freedom for our souls at any price. let us wear strange clothes, and recite
our poetry upon the streets. let us--"

but i was not in a mood for my facetious devil--i flung him aside and
sprang up and fled out to the street (this in thought, of course). what do
i need with others? i exclaimed--with others to help me dare? this has to
do with _me_! and it has to do with me _now_--with this moment!
am i to give up and let myself go down for such a phantom as this! for such
a dread as that wooden-headed men and women will think me "queer"! am i to
stay in a prison such as that--to be bound by a chain such as _that_?
i--i, who go about trying to persuade myself that this world is nothing
to me--that this world is nothing to any one--that it is a phantom--that
the soul is truth! when i say that the soul is truth, do i mean it? do i
_mean_ it? and if i do mean it, will i act by it--will i act by it
now--_now_, while i see it? will i fling off this nightmare, will i
tear my way through these wrappings that have choked me? will i say, once
and for all time, that i will be myself--that i will live my life--and that
no man shall stop me--that no man shall make me afraid? will i take the
battle upon me and win it--win it _now_--fling off the last rag of
it--put the world straight behind me--_now_--_here_? spread the
wings of my soul and take my flight into the far spaces of myself! and
dwell there--stay there--hold to the task and give it not up though it kill
me--now--_now_!

these thoughts took hold of me--they made my brain reel--and i cried aloud
in excitement. i had not been so much awake since the day i came out of the
woods! i said the word--i said it--the mad word that i had not heard for
six long months--that i had not heard since i wrote the last lines of my
poem and came back to the haunts of men. and i clinched my hands, and
stamped upon the ground, and shouted: "come on! come on!"--to the legions
of my spirit. and it was like the taking flight of a great swarm of birds
within me--a rushing of wings and a surging upward, a singing for joy as
of a symphony. and there was singing in my soul, the surge of it caught
me--and i waved my arms and went striding on, shouting still, "come on!
come on!--

"now! _now_! we will have it out with them--here--_here_! we will
fight our fight and win it, and they shall not turn us back--no, by god,
they shall not! and they may take it as they please--my soul is
free--_free_ once again! away! _away!_"

and i felt the breeze of the mountains about me, and heard the rushing
of the storm-wind and the trampling of the thunder. there awoke the old
rush in my heart, the old valkyrie music that flies over the forests and
mountains. and i laughed as i sang it; i heard the war-horses neighing, and
yelled to them--faster and faster--higher and higher--away from earth and
all men!--

       *       *       *       *       *

and then suddenly i felt some one seize me by the shoulder and shake me,
and heard a gruff voice say: "here! here! what's the matter with you?" and
i stared, half-dazed. it was a big policeman, and around me i saw a sea of
staring faces, wild-eyed children, women gazing in fright, boys jeering;
and the windows were filled with yet another crowd!

"what's the matter with you?" demanded the policeman again. "are you drunk,
or crazy!"

and then i realized. but the fire was still blazing in me, and a wild rage
whirled over me. "then it is by this that i am to be stopped!" i gasped.
"by _this_! it is not possible after all, it seems; and i'm to be
dragged back after all!--by heaven, we'll see!"

and so i gave the cry again--the cry of the valkyrs that is madness to me!
do you not hear it?--and i was away again and free!

what does a man want for his soul, if it be not just to strive, and to be
resisted, and still to strive? what difference makes anything else--time,
place or conditions? i was myself again--and what else did i care about? i
felt the policeman take me by the collar and march me down the street; but
i hardly knew that--i was on the mountains, and i laughed and sang. the
very hatefulness of what was about me was my desperation--i would make head
against such things or i would die in the attempt! i would be free!--i
would live! i would live my life; and not the life of these people about
me! i would fight and win, i would hold fast my heart, i would be true
though the heavens fell! i would have it out, then and there, as i said--i
would not come back to earth until i was master of myself.

and so when i stood in the station-house and the sergeant asked me my name,
i said: "desire is my name, and the soul is my home!" and then because they
shook me and worried me, i stretched forth my arms and cried out: "o god,
my father--thou who art my help and my life--thou soul of my soul--shall i
go back for these things?--shall i fear for these things? no, no--while i
have life i will not! i will live for the truth, i will be crushed no
longer!"

they led me to a cell, and when i heard the door shut i laughed like a
madman for joy. and then--ah, then--who can tell it? they came--all my
angels and all my demons! all my muses and all my nymphs! and the bases
of the earth rocked and the heavens danced and sang; and i mounted on the
wings of the ages, and saw the joys of the systems and the dancing of the
young suns. until i could bear it no more, and fell down and sobbed, and
cried out to my soul that it was enough, enough!

       *       *       *       *       *

and afterward i sat there on the stone floor, and ate bread and water and
ambrosial peace; and a doctor came in to see me, and asked me who i was.
and i laughed--oh, who ever laughed like that? and i said, _"i am the
author of the captive!"_

he left me and i sat there, shaking my head and pounding the stone floor
for joy. and i sang again, and sang again. yes, the author of the captive!
and captive myself, and free at last!

it was far into the night when i stopped singing; and then i lay down and
never before had i known such peace; for i had found the way--i had seen
the light--i was delivered from all fear and dulness for the rest of my
days! i was so excited i could not sleep--when i fell asleep at last it was
from sheer exhaustion.

and when they roused me the next morning i bounded to my feet like a shot,
and shouted to my soul, and was up and away through the forest like a
startled deer again! they tried their very best to catch me, but they could
not. i had not lived in the woods for nothing, i knew the paths, i knew
where the mountains were. and when they thought they had me in court, i was
on the very summits--and laughing and drunk with the mountain air!

i have a keen sense of humor,--and of course i am never so drunk that i
do not know i'm drunk, and know just what i'm drunk about--else how could
i write poems about it? do you think that when shakespeare cried out his
"blow ye winds and crack your cheeks!" he did not know just what he was
saying? ah!--and when i saw all these queer little men about me, staring
and wondering--and so solemn!--i laughed the inextinguishable laughter of
olympus, and shouted so that they dragged me out of court in a hurry.

       *       *       *       *       *

and then there came the end! they took me to the insane asylum, and i sat
down on the floor of a cell and gazed at myself in amazement and panted: so
there _is_ a way you can live, after all! there _is_ a way you
can make them support you! there _is_ a way you can do all your work
in peace, and worship the lord in the beauty of holiness! i could scarcely
believe it all--it took half an hour for me to realize it. and then i
shouted that i was saved!--and fell to work at shaping that mad song of the
west wind i had been so full of.

       *       *       *       *       *

and then suddenly i heard a muffled voice say: "what in the dickens are you
making all that rumpus for?" and i stared about me and saw that i was still
crouching by the window in my room! and i shrank back and quivered with
rage, because i knew that i had been making a noise and that some one out
in the hall had been listening to me!

"i am pleased to be able to tell you that your poem is a great deal better
than i expected to find it. i am forced to write briefly by reason of
pressure of business; but you have very considerable literary gifts. the
work is clearly made whole of sincerity; it shows a considerable command of
expression, and a considerable understanding of style. it has qualities of
imagination and of emotional insight, and is obviously the fruit of a wide
reading. but besides these things, it is exactly as i expected, and as i
told you--the work is very narrow in the range of its appeal; you can not
in the least blame the publishers for declining it, because it is true that
very few people would care for it. my own judgment is hardly capable in the
matter, because i myself am not an idealist. recording my own opinion, i
found the poem monotonous, and not especially interesting; but then, i say
that of much that some other people consider great poetry.

"my advice to you is just what it was before--that you go out into the
world and become acquainted with life. not knowing you personally, i could
not counsel you definitely, but i should think that what would benefit you
most would be a good stiff course in plain, every-day newspaper reporting.
newspaper reporters have many deficiencies, but at least they learn to keep
in touch with their audiences, and to write in a way that takes hold of the
people. you may not welcome this advice--but we seldom welcome what is good
for us."

it is enough if you can classify a man; give him a name--and then it's all
out of the way. if he have faith and fire and aspiration and worship--and
you have not--why, say that he is an idealist, and that you are something
else, and let it go at that.

month more to the time i said i should have to go to work!

and new year's day--my soul, if i had foreseen this last new year's! i
thank heaven for that blessing, at least.

who are these men that i should submit to their judgments? these men and
their commonplace lives--are they not that very world out of which i have
fought my way, by the toil of nights and days?--and now i must come back
and listen to their foolish judgments about my song!

"this man [nietzsche's ideal] takes willingly upon himself the sorrow
of speaking the truth. his chief thought is this: a happy life is an
impossibility; the highest that man can attain is a heroic life, a life in
which, amid the greatest difficulties, something is striven for which, in
one way or other, proves for the good of all. to what is truly human only
the true men can lift us, those who seem to have come into being through a
leap of nature, the thinkers and discoverers, the artists and producers,
and those who achieve more through their being than their doing; the noble,
the good in a great sense, those in whom the genius of the good works.
these men are the goal of history. nietzsche formulates the sentence
'humanity shall labor continually at this, to beget solitary great men--and
this and nothing else is its task.'--

"here nietzsche has reached the final answer to his question 'what is
culture?' for upon this rest the fundamental principles of culture, and the
duties which it imposes. it lays upon me the duty to place myself actively
in relation to the great human ideals. its chief thought is this: to every
one who will look for it and partake of it, it sets the task; to labor in
himself and outside of himself at the begetting of the thinker and the
artist, the truth-loving and the beauty-loving man, the pure and good
personality--and therewith at the fulfilment of nature....

"in our day a so-called culture institution signifies only too often an
arrangement by which the cultured, moving in closed ranks, force to one
side all those solitary and contrary ones whose striving is directed to
higher things. also among the learned there is so far lacking, as a rule,
all sense for the genius that is coming into being, and every feeling for
the work of the contemporary and struggling soul. therefore, in spite of
the irresistible and restless advance in all technical and specialized
fields, the conditions for the originating of the great are so little
improved that the opposition to the highly gifted has rather increased than
diminished.

"from the government the superior individuals can not expect much. it helps
them rarely when it takes them into its service, very certainly it will
help them only when it gives them full independence. only true culture can
prevent their early becoming weary or exhausted, and protect them from the
exasperating battle with culture-philistinism."

those words made my blood tingle, they made me tremble. alone, miserable,
helpless--here was a voice at last, a friend! i dropped the book and i went
to the library, and i was back with "also sprach zarathustra" in an hour.

       *       *       *       *       *

i have been reading it for two days--reading it in a state of excitement,
forgetting everything. here is a man!--here is a man! the first night that
i read it i kicked my heels together and laughed aloud in glee, like a
child. _oh_, it was so fine! and to find things like this already
written, and in the world! great heavens, it was like finding a gold mine
underneath my feet; and i have forgotten all my troubles again, forgotten
everything! i have found a man who understands me, a man to be my friend!

i do not know what the name friedrich nietzsche conveys to the average
cultured american. i can only judge by my own case--i have kept pace with
our literary movements and i have read the standard journals and reviews;
but i have never come upon even a reference to friedrich nietzsche, except
as a byword and a jest.

       *       *       *       *       *

i had rather live my own life than any other man's life. my own vision is
my home. but every great man's inspiration is a challenge, and until you
have mastered it you can not go on.

i speak not of poets, nor of philosophers, but of religious teachers, of
prophets; and i speak but my opinion--let every man form his own. i say
that i have read all those that men honor, and that a greater prophet than
this man has not come upon the earth in centuries. i think of emerson and
carlyle as the religious teachers, the prophets, of this time; and beside
this mighty spirit emerson is a child and carlyle a man without a faith or
an idea. i call him the john baptist of the new dispensation, the first
high priest of the religion of evolution; and i bid the truth-seeker read
well his bible, for in it lies the future of mankind for ages upon ages to
come.

       *       *       *       *       *

half that i love in my soul's life i owe to the prophet of nazareth. the
other half i owe,--not to nietzsche, but to the new dispensation of which
he is a priest. nietzsche will stand alone; but he is nevertheless the
child of his age--he sings what thousands feel.

       *       *       *       *       *

it is a disadvantage to be the first man. if you are the first man you see
but half-truths and you hate your enemies. when you seek truth, truly, all
systems and all faiths of men--they are beautiful to you--born of sorrow,
and hallowed with love; but they will not satisfy you, and you put them by.
you do not let them influence you one way or the other; you can no more
find truth while you are bound to them by hatred than while you are bound
to them by love. there are dreary places in "also sprach zarathustra,"
narrownesses and weaknesses too; they come whenever the writer is thinking
of the evils of the hour, whenever he is gazing, not on the vision of his
soul, but on the half-truths of the men about him.

       *       *       *       *       *

when i speak of christ let no man think of christianity. i speak of a
prince of the soul, the boldest, the freest, the noblest of men that i
know. with the thousand systems that mankind has made in his memory, i have
simply nothing in any way to do.

       *       *       *       *       *

to me all morality is one. morality is hunger and thirst after
righteousness. morality is a quality of will. the differences that there
are between christ and nietzsche are differences of the intellect--where no
man is final.

the doctrine of each is a doctrine of sacrifice; with one it is a sacrifice
of love, with the other it is a sacrifice of labor. for myself, i care not
for the half-truths of any man. i said to my soul, "shall i cast out love
for labor?" and my soul replied, "for what wilt thou labor but love?"

       *       *       *       *       *

moral sublimity lies in the escape from self. the doctrine of christ is a
negation of life, that of nietzsche an affirmation; it seems to me much
easier to attain to sublimity with the former.

it is easier to die for righteousness than to live for it. if you are to
die, you have but to fix your eyes upon your vision, and see that you do
not take them away. but the man who will _live_ for righteousness--he
must plant and reap, must gather fire-wood and establish a police-force;
and to do these things nobly is not easy; to do them sublimely seems hardly
possible at all.

twenty centuries ago the jewish world was a little plain, and god a loving
father. he held you in his arms, he spoke to you in every dream, in every
fantasy, in every accident. life was very short--but a little trial--you
had only to be patient, and nothing mattered. society did not exist--only
your neighbor existed. knowledge did not exist, nor was it needed--the
world was to end--perhaps to-night--and what difference made all the rest?
you took no heed for the morrow--for would not your father send you bread?
you resisted not evil--for if you died, was not that all that you could
ask?

it was with such a sweet and simple faith as this that the victory of jesus
christ was won. these were his ideas, and as the soul was all-consuming
with him, he lived by them and died by them, and stands as the symbol of
faith.

       *       *       *       *       *

and now twenty centuries have gone by. and a new teacher has come to whom
also the soul is all-consuming. what ideas has _he_? and what task
does he face?

i speak not to children. i speak to men seeking truth.

in twenty centuries we have learned that god is not a father who answers
prayers and works miracles and holds out his arms at the goal. we have
come shuddering to the awful mystery of being; strange and terrible
words have been spoken--words never to be forgotten--"phenomenon," and
"thing-in-itself"; not knowing what these words mean, you are ignorant and
recreant to the truth; _knowing_ what they mean, you tug no more at
the veil. also we have learned that time and change are our portion, "the
plastic dance of circumstance"; we talk no more of immortality. we have
turned our hopes to the new birth of time, to the new goal of our labor,
the new parent of our love, that we name society.

and likewise evolution has come, which is the whole of knowledge. and we
have learned of starry systems, of the building of worlds, of the pageant
of history and the march of mind. out of all these things has come a new
duty, which is not peace, but battle--which is not patience, but
will--which is not death, but life.

       *       *       *       *       *

there is no room in the world of evolution for the doctrine of
non-resistance to evil. non-resistance to evil is the negation of life, and
the negation of life is the negation of faith. how shall you resist not
evil when life is action and not passion? when not a morsel of food can you
touch except by the right that you are more fitted to survive than that
morsel? how when you know that you rose from the beast by resistance? and
that you stay above the beast by resistance? will you give up the farm land
to be jungle again? or will you teach the beasts your non-resistance? and
the trees of the forest to crowd no more your land!

it is no longer possible to build a heaven and reject the earth. such as
life is you have to take it.

       *       *       *       *       *

and you have to live it. the huge machinery of society is on your hands,
with all its infinite complications, its infinite possibilities of beauty
and joy. your life is, as ever, a sacrifice; all life is, as ever, a
sacrifice; but it is a sacrifice to man--a sacrifice to the best. once your
task was self-abnegation, and that was easy; now it is self-assertion, and
that is hard. knowing what you are, you will dare to live, not for your own
sake, but that strength and beauty may be in the world. knowing what you
might be, you choose infinite toil for your portion, and in the humility of
toil you find your holiest peace. your enemy you resist with all your soul,
not for hatred of your enemy, but for love of the right. if he were not
evil he could not be your enemy; and being evil, he has no right to be.
your conscience to you is no longer a shame, but a joy; you think no
more of infinite sin, but of infinite virtue.--and for the rest, you do
not attain perfection, and you are not worshiped as a god; you are much
troubled by trivialities, and the battle tries your soul. but you make no
truce with lies, and you never lay down your sword; you keep your eyes upon
a far goal, and you leave the world better than you found it. when you come
to die you have no fear, but a song; for you are master of yourself, and
you have learned to know that which you are.

       *       *       *       *       *

--and there is only to add--that whether you believe these things or not,
they are what you actually _do_. it seems to me not desirable that
one's belief should be less than one's practise.

has any one, at this end of the nineteenth century, a clear idea of what
the poets of the ages called _inspiration_? if no one have, i will
describe it. with the least remainder of superstition in him a man would
scarcely be able to put aside the idea that he was merely the incarnation,
the mouthpiece, the medium of overwhelming powers. the idea of revelation
in the mind describes exactly the state of affairs--that suddenly, with
unspeakable certainty and fineness, something became visible and audible,
something that shakes and pervades one to the depths. one hears--he does
not seek; he takes--he does not ask who gives; like lightning gleams out
a thought, of necessity, formed without hesitation--i have never had a
choice. an ecstasy, whose colossal strain breaks in the middle with a
stream of tears, in the course of which the step becomes, involuntary, now
raging, now slow; a state in which one is completely beside himself, with
the distinctest consciousness of countless shudderings and quiverings, even
to the toes of his feet; a depth of joy in which all that is painful and
somber serves, not as a contrast, but as conditioned, as demanded, as a
necessary color in such an overflow of light; an instinct of rhythmic
relations which overleaps vast spaces of forms; all happening in the
highest degree involuntarily, but as if in a storm of sensations of
freedom, of infinity, of power, of divinity.--this is my experience of
inspiration; i doubt not but that one must needs go back thousands of
years to find one who might say, "it is also mine."

when zarathustra came into the next city, which lay beside the forest, he
found in that place much people gathered together in the market; for they
had been called that they should see a rope-dancer. and zarathustra spoke
thus unto the people:

_"i teach ye the over-man._ the man is something who shall be
overcome. what have ye done to overcome him?

"all being before this made something beyond itself: and you will be the
ebb of this great flood, and rather go back to the beast than overcome the
man?

"what is the ape to the man? a mockery or a painful shame. and even so
shall man be to the over-man: a mockery or a painful shame.

"man is a cord, tied between beast and over-man--a cord above an abyss.

"a perilous arriving, a perilous traveling, a perilous looking backward, a
perilous trembling and standing still.

"what is great in man is that he is a bridge, and no goal; what can be
loved in man is that he is a going-over and a going-under.

"i love them that know not how to live, be it even as those going under,
for such are those going across.

"i love them that are great in scorn, because these are they that are great
in reverence, and _arrows of longing toward the other shore!"_

"i feel no more with you; these clouds which i see under me, these clouds
black and heavy over which i laugh--just these are your storm-clouds.

exalted.

"who among you can both laugh and be exalted?

"who climbs upon the highest mountains, he laughs at all sorrow-play and
sorrow-reality.

"bold, untroubled, mocking, full of power--so will wisdom have us; she is a
woman and loves always but the warrior.

"you say to me: 'life is hard to bear.' but for what had you your pride in
the morning, and in the evening your submission?...

"i would believe only in a god who knew how to dance.

"and when i saw my devil, i found him earnest, profound, deep, solemn; he
was the spirit of heaviness--through him fail all things.

free _to_ what?

"canst thou give to thyself thy good and thine evil, and hang thy will
above thee as thy law? canst thou be thine own judge, and avenger of thy
law?

"fearful it is to be alone with the judge and the avenger of thy law. so is
a stone flung out into empty space and into the icy breath of isolation.--

oh ye visions and apparitions of my youth! oh all ye glances of love, ye
godlike moments! how swiftly you died in me! i remember you to-day as my
dead.

from you, my dearest dead, there comes to me a sweet odor, heart-melting,
tear-melting. truly it shakes and melts the heart of the lonely seaman.

still am i the richest and the most to be envied--i, the most lonely. for
i _had_ you, and you have me still; say, to whom fell, as to me, such
rose-apples from the trees?...

_me_ to kill, they strangled you, you song-birds of my hopes. yea, at
you, the dearest, shot wickedness its arrows--to strike my heart!...

this word will i speak to my enemies: "what is all murder of man beside
that which ye did to me?"

thus, in the good hour, spake my purity: "godlike shall all being be to
me."

then ye fell upon me with your foul spirits; ah, whither now hath the good
hour fled?

"all days shall be holy to me"--so spake once the wisdom of my youth; truly
the speech of a happy wisdom.

but then you enemies stole away my nights and sold them to sleepless
torment; ah, whither now hath the happy wisdom fled?...

as a blind man once i went a blissful way; then you threw rubbish in the
blind man's way; and now he is weary of the old blind ascendings....

and once would i dance as never had i danced before; above all the heavens
away would i dance. and then you lured away my dearest singer!...

only in the dance can i speak metaphors of the highest things:--and now my
highest metaphor remained unspoken in my limbs!

unspoken and undelivered remained my highest hope! and there died all the

put it down--there is nothing kills the soul in a man so much as that. when
you wait your life is outside of yourself; you hope,--you are at the mercy
of others--at the mercy of indifference and accident and god knows what.

but again i cry, "what can i do? if there is anything i have not done--tell
me! tell me!"

here i sit, and i have but seven dollars left to my name, including what i
made by the shoveling. and i sit and watch the day creep on me like a wild

i have stopped reading nietzsche. i could not stand any more of it. it does
not satisfy me.

it is not merely that i am so weak now, and that his mocking goads me. i
would have been through with him in any case. he is so narrow--so
one-sided.

it is reaction from the present, of course, that accounts for it. too
much gazing upon the world, that has led him to believe that love of man
necessarily implies compromise.

there are two words that are absent from his writings--they are love and
humanity; and so it never satisfies you, you are always discontented, you
have always to correct and supply.

oh why do those publishers take so long! i wait and yearn; i grow sick with
waiting and yearning.

i never allowed any weakness in my soul before; i never made any terms with
it. i blamed everything upon myself. and now that my whole life is weakness
and misery, i writhe and struggle--i turn back always on myself, suspecting
myself, blaming myself. i can not lay it to the world, i can not get into
the habit--it is such a miserable habit! how many millions there are of
them--poor, querulous wretches, blaming their fate, crying out against the
world's injustice and neglect--crying out against the need of working,
wishing for this and that--discontented, impotent, miserable! oh my
god--and i am one of such!

i can not bear the sound of my own voice when i complain! i hear the world
answering me--and i take the part of the world! "why don't you be a man and
go out and earn your way? why don't you face your fate? you prate about
your message--what business has a man with a message that is too much for
him? what business have you with weakness--what _excuse_ have you for
weakness?"

and so i came to see it. the world is right and i am all wrong! and the

the reason that i shudder so at the prospect of having to face the world

go out into that hellish market. i could be any man's slave, do any
drudgery--because i saw a light ahead--i saw deliverance--i had a purpose!

only one thing i can do--only one way that i can get free--and that is by
doing my work, by writing books. and i have done all that i can do, i have

they regret, of course, and hold the ms. at my disposal. i went up to get
it this afternoon, and half by accident i met the man i had seen before. i
had a talk with him. he was a very curious personage.

he seemed to have been interested in the captive. "i'll tell you," he said,
"you know there's really some extraordinary work in that poem. i believe
that you have it in you to make some literature before you get through, mr.
stirling."

"do you?" i said.

"yes," he replied, "i feel pretty sure of it. you ask me to tell you about
it--so you mustn't mind if i speak frankly. and of course it's very crude.
you haven't found your voice yet, you're seeking for mastery, and your work
is obviously young. anybody can see in a few lines that it's young--it's
one of those things like goetz von berlichingen, or die rauber--you tear a
passion to tatters, you want to rip the universe up the back. but of course
that wears off by and by; it isn't well to take life too seriously, you
know, and i don't think it'll be long before you come to feel that the
captive isn't natural or possible--or desirable either."

the publisher was smoking a cigar. he puffed for a moment and then he
asked, "what are you doing now?"

"nothing just at present," said i.

"i should have supposed you'd be writing another poem," he
replied,--"though of course as a matter of fact the wisest thing you can do
is to wait and learn. your next book will be entirely different, you can be
quite sure--you won't be so anxious to get hold of all the world and make
it go your way."

i smiled feebly. "possibly not," i said.

"i'll tell you a story," said the publisher--"speaking about youthful
aspirations! i was talking to mr. x---- last night, the author of ----.
[footnote: the manuscript names an extremely popular historical novel.] you
wouldn't think x---- was the sort of man to be reforming the world, would
you? but he told me about his earliest work, that he said he had tucked
away in a drawer, and it turned out he was like all other authors. this
was a socialist story, it seems, and the hero delivered fiery speeches
six pages long. and x---- said that he had written it and taken it to a
publisher, expecting to upset the world a week after it appeared, but that
he never could get anybody to publish it, and gave it up finally and went
into journalism. the funny part of it was that he had sent it here, and
when he told me about it, i remembered looking it over and writing him just
about what i'm telling you."

the publisher smoked for a moment or two. "you see, mr. stirling," he said
at last, "he had to wait ten years before he 'arrived.' so you must not be
discouraged. have you read his book?"

"no, i have not."

"it is a very pretty piece of work--it's been many months since it
came out, but they say it's still selling in the thousands. don't get
discouraged, mr. stirling, keep at it, because you have real talent, i
assure you."

i rose to go, and he shook my hand. "take my advice," he said, "and write
something more practicable than a tragedy. but of course don't forget in
any case that we shall always be very happy to read anything of yours at
any time."

--i walked down the street meditating. i will get over it again, of course;
but to-night i sat in the dark and the cold, shivering. and i asked myself
if it must not be so after all. "_is_ it true, the thing that i did;
is it _natural_?" i said. "or must it not be exaggerated and crude, as
they all tell me! and uninteresting!--what is the use of it? i tormented
myself that way and tore myself to pieces, but it does not stir any one
else."

ah, of course it's all dead in me--and i'm prepared to believe anything
they tell me! it's overwrought, it's young, it's pitched in too high a key,
it's strained and unnatural, it takes life too seriously! certainly at any
rate they are right that i shall never, never do the same thing again.

but unfortunately i don't feel like writing anything else. i don't know
anything about historical novels.

to-day an idea occurred to me, one that should have occurred before. once
upon a time i was introduced to the editor of the ----. perhaps he will
not remember it, i said. but anyhow, why not try? i will take him the
captive--perhaps he can use it in the magazine--who knows?

i knew nothing better to do, so i went there. he was very polite--he did
remember my face. he was fearfully busy, it seemed. he did not think there
was much likelihood of a magazine's publishing a blank-verse tragedy; but i
told him how i had worked, and he said he'd read it.

and so there's one chance more!

my poor, foolish heart is always ready to tremble with new hope. but faith
in that book was so _ground_ into it!

--i asked him to read it at once, i explained that i was in great haste. i
think he understood what i meant. my clothes show it.

i have been hoarding my money--counting every cent. i dread the world so!
now that i am so broken, so laden with misery, it sounds about me as one
jeer of mockery. but i shall have to be hunting a place soon--you never can
tell how long it may take you, and the chances are so terrible.

i will not do anything until i hear from this one man, however. he promised
to let me know in a week.

as possible. he said: "i am honestly so rushed that i do not know where to
turn. but i will do the best i possibly can."

i said--poor, pitiful cringing, is it not terrible?--that i'd be up his way
again in three days, and did he think he could have it read by then. he
said he was not sure, but that he'd try.

and so i went away. now i have two dollars and twenty-three cents. i have
to pay my rent to-morrow, and that will leave me a dollar and a half. i
can make that do me seven or eight days--i have one or two things at home.

wild--i had an offer at last! and guess what it was--of all the things that
i had made up my mind i could not bear--to be a waiter!

it is, i believe, what a man should call a rare opportunity. it is a fairly
good restaurant just off broadway; and i get ten dollars and tips. poor me!

wanted to know why i had not been working all these months, and so on. she
has a red face, and drinks, i think.

then i had to take a load of my best books--my poor, few precious books
that i have loved--and sell them at a second-hand bookstore. when i had
sold them i had to hire a waiter's suit for a week, until i had money to
buy it. and then with that awful thing on i went down to the restaurant.

to live? that was just how i felt--just how! oh my god, the indignity of

get to it before that, so you take it and see if you can find some one else

like this?

think of it--this money that these people squander--do you know what it is?
it is the toil of society! that is what it is,--it is _my_ toil--it is
the toil of the millions that swarm in the tenements where i live--it is
the toil of the laborers, the beasts of burden of society, in the cities
and in the country.

think about it, i cry, think about it!--can i not find any word, is there
nothing i can do or say now or at any time, to make men see it? why, you
take it for granted--_i_ have taken it for granted all my days--that
money should belong to the brutal rich to squander in whatever inanity may
please them! but it never dawns upon you that this money is _the toil
of the human race_! money is the representation of all that human toil
creates--of all _value_; it is houses that laborers build, it is grain
that farmers raise, it is books that poets write! and see what becomes of
it--see! _see_! or are you blind or mad, that you _will_ not see?

everywhere the same. go to the opera-house any night and you may see
blasphemous vanity enough to feed the starving of this city for a year.
walk up fifth avenue and see them driving; or go to newport and see them
there. why, i read in the papers once of a woman who gave a ball--and the
little fact has stuck in my mind ever since that she wore a dress trimmed

society shall come to its own, i demand that there shall be intelligence in
the world! i demand that the toil of the millions shall not be for the
pride of the few! i demand that it shall not be to buy diamonds and dresses

tess of the d'urbervilles is one of the most unconvincing books i ever

i am shown a "pure woman," and by and by i learn, to my perplexity, that
she has been seduced; after which she continues the "pure woman" again, and
i am asked to agonize over her troubles! but all the time i keep saying,
"this is not a woman that you are showing me at all--a woman with a soul;
it is a puppet figure that you suppose 'seduced' for the sake of the
story."

it is our absurd english ideas of "propriety" that make possible such
things. if the author had had to show the seduction of "tess" the weakness
of the thing would have been plain in an instant. that he did not show it
was his lack of conscience. there is no propriety in art but truth.

interesting thing, i like it very much."

i stared at him gasping. then i waited to hear him say--"but i regret"--but
he didn't!

"i can't tell you anything definite about it," he said. "i want to submit
it to the firm. i wouldn't undertake to accept any such unusual thing for
the magazine without consulting them, and especially seeing if they will
bring it out afterward--"

"you are thinking of using it in the magazine!" i cried.

"as i tell you, i can't say positively. i can only tell you what i think of
it. i will have them read it at once--"

"i will take it to them to-day!" i put in.

"no," he said, "you need not, for i am going there this afternoon, and i
will take it, and ask them to read it immediately."

i can't remember what else he said. i was deaf, crazy! i rushed home,
talking to myself incoherently. i remember sitting here in a chair and
saying aloud, "oh, it can't be! it is impossible! that it should be good
enough to publish in a magazine like that! it is some mistake--it will all

endless mournfulness that is in my heart surged up in me like a tide, and
suddenly i began to cry like a child.

"it has come to me too late," i exclaimed, "too late! i can't believe
it--it doesn't mean anything to me. i don't care anything about it--i mean
the poem! _i don't believe in it myself_!"

god, do you know i said that, and _meant_ it? i said more--i sat and

at the magazine and think of it there. i walk past the publishers', and
think of it there! i have been inquiring all about publishing, about terms
and all that sort of thing. it makes my brain reel--why, they might pay me
five hundred dollars for it! think of it--five hundred dollars!--i could go
crazy with such a thought as that.

and then i think what the reviews will say of it, and i cry, "oh, no, it

me to the manuscript clerk. she said she had never heard of the captive.

"but it's here somewhere," i said, "the editor brought it here."

"there is no manuscript ever comes here," she answered, "that is not
entered on my books."

"but," i said, "some member of the firm must have it."

"if any member of the firm got it," she said, smiling, "the first thing he
would do would be to bring it to me to enter in the books."

i insisted. i wanted to see somebody in the firm, but she answered me there
was no use. finally she suggested that they might know something about it
up in the offices of the magazine. i went there, but no, no one had ever
heard of it there.

oh my soul, i think this is the most frightful thing--is it not simply a
nightmare? i have been pacing the floor to-night in an agony. _they have
never seen that manuscript_!

i was going by there to-day, and i couldn't withstand the temptation; the
week was not up, but i said: "if i inquire, there's no reason why he should
know about it." i went in.

and that terrible clerk--she smiled at me still! the more i talked, the
more she shook her head. "there's no such manuscript ever been seen here,"
she said. i showed her the letter, and that decided her to go in and see
the firm. they sent out word that neither they nor their readers had ever
heard of it, but that they would write to the editor at once.

oh, i think this is horrible--horrible! and then just guess what i did! i
couldn't bear the agony--i went to the other place, and he wasn't there,
and so at last i went to his club.

he wasn't at the club, but they told me where he was; and i spent ten cents
telephoning him. at this place they said he had an engagement to be there
later, so i spent another ten cents, and that time i found him. i told him
who i was. "the week isn't up yet," i said, "but the firm say they have
never received the manuscript."

"so?" he said; his voice sounded hard, i thought, and it made me shudder.
"you come up to see me the day after to-morrow at ten o'clock, and you'll
hear about your manuscript."

and that is all. and i walked out of the great, rich club, and i have been
pacing up and down in my own garret ever since. i am almost too ill with
anxiety to stand.

i don't know how to tell this thing. i am simply dazed. i had an experience
to-day--the most hideous thing that i think ever happened to me in my life.
oh, i have been like a madman ever since--i lost my head--i did not know
what i was doing. i was really crazy--it is three o'clock in the morning,
now, but i shall write it down--i can not sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

to-day i went up to see that man as he told me to. i went trembling with
suspense--just think, it has been eleven weeks since this agony began. and
i went into his office--he was alone; and when he saw me he sprang to his
feet--my soul, he looked like a tiger. he stood there in the middle of the
room fairly gasping with rage.

"so," he cried, "you've come, have you! i tell you, young man, i have never
been subjected to such an outrage as this in my life! i would not read
another manuscript for you--why, i wouldn't stand for such an imposition
from balzac or thackeray--no, sir, i wouldn't!"

i stared at the man simply speechless with astonishment. "why," i panted,
"what do you mean?"

"what do i mean? why, you have hounded me about this city until i'm crazy.
there's no place i can go to escape you. you come to my office, you come
here, you come to my club! you have made yourself a perfect pest at the
publishers to every one! why--"

he stopped out of breath. of course i have no courage or head with men--i
was ready to grovel at his feet. "my dear sir," i pleaded, "i assure you
i didn't mean to do anything of the kind--it was only that the clerk kept
telling me--"

"i don't care what the clerk kept telling you! i tell you that that
manuscript has been in the hands of the company since the day i told you i
would leave it there. of course there have been delays, there is all sorts
of routine to go through with; but suppose all our contributors did the
same thing--what would we do?"

he was talking at me as if expecting a reply. fortunately the right words
came to my lips--i was really ready to cry with shame and perplexity.

"i don't think it is quite the same with all your contributors," i said,
with a trembling voice. "while i have been waiting i have been simply
starving."

it seemed to clear the atmosphere. he stared at me, and then he sat down.
he was ashamed of himself, i could see. "why," he said, "you couldn't have
been paid anything for months."

"i didn't know," i said, "i didn't know anything about it. but i have been
starving."

he spoke more quietly. "mr. stirling," he said, "i'm very sorry about this,
the whole thing has been unfortunate. excuse me that i spoke angrily; let
us not think any more about it."

i stood there, feeling almost like crying, i was so nervous.

"now, about that manuscript," he went on, "i'm doing what i can to learn
about it. it's been there all along, as i told you, and you will hear about
it soon. why, mr. stirling, i even took the trouble to send my secretary
down there yesterday to make sure that it was all right."

"i did not want you to go to any such trouble," i stammered.

"that's all right," he said, "don't mention it. now they will have decided
in a few days, and i will write you--"

"no, please do not," i said, still with my abject humility. "don't take any
more trouble--let me go there and find out--"

"by no means!" said he. "take my advice and don't go near there again under
any circumstances. you can't tell how much an author hurts himself by
troubling a publisher as you have done. don't go near there--let me write
to you."

i promised that i would; and then with more abjectness i got myself out of
that room, and i went out and sat down upon a step near by, simply shaking
like a leaf.

"oh, heavens!" i gasped. "that was horrible! horrible!"

i sat dazed--thinking about it--thinking it over and over--i couldn't

day--had he not told me to come there? and had he not said i should have a
report?

--and then suddenly something flashed over me that made me leap! that
firm had written him a letter the day before yesterday asking about the
manuscript, and _that_ was why he was angry! and he had sent his
secretary down to inquire!--but why in heaven's name should he send his
secretary down to inquire _when he had a telephone connecting with the
firm right there in his office_!

and so i saw it--all in one instant the thing flashed over me!

i was so wild i paid a car-fare--i rode straight as a die down to that
place, and i went in and saw the clerk.

"he has sent the manuscript now," i said, "hasn't he?"

"yes," she said.

"he sent it in yesterday?" i said.

"yes."

"he sent it by his secretary, didn't he?"

"yes," she said again.

"thank you," i answered, and went out.

_done_ to him--why should he have treated me so? what does it mean? i
am baffled every way i turn.

what do you mean? what do you mean? tell me, above all, _why_ you did
it! were you torturing me on purpose? or did you simply forget it? but
then, how could you forget it when you had to tell me all those miserable
falsehoods? and when you had to write me those letters?

and then to-day!

that is the thing that goads me most--to-day! i stood there cringed before
you like a beaten cur--you kicked me--you spit upon me! and it was every
bit of it a lie! that insolent rage of yours--why, it wasn't even genuine!
you weren't even angry--you knew that you had no reason to be angry--that
you had treated me as if i were a worm to tread on! and yet you stood there
and abused me!

oh--why, the thing is madness to think of! it is more madness the more you
realize it! i have never known anything like it before in my life.

yes--actually--it is something quite new to me. i have met blind
people--people who would not heed me--but a really evil person i have never
known before! a person who has no respect for another's rights--who would
trample upon another! oh, you miserable wretch--and the lies--the lies! the
hateful sneaking of it--you black-hearted, insolent man! the manuscript had
been there all the time! _the delays, the routine_! and you had sent
your secretary down to inquire! and above all--oh, above all--the prince of
them--i must not go near there lest i should injure myself! i must not go
near them--they were so weary of seeing me! and i never saw a single soul
there in my life but one clerk!

i never suffered such a thing as this before in all my days--deliberate,
brutal injustice! and that i should be so placed as to be a victim of such
a thing--that i should have to hang upon your words and to be at your mercy
for eleven weeks of agony! you are a great editor, a clubman, a rich man!

you were--if you had any idea of publishing it--then why did you use me in
this way? where was the manuscript all this time? what did you mean to do
with it? how long did you expect me to wait? and what object did you have
in telling me untruths about it meanwhile?

--the whole thing is as blank to me as night. that a man should have in him
so much infinite indifference about another as to leave that manuscript in
a drawer, and write me that i was to "have a report on it within a week"!
why, it is something of which i can not even think. and then to get out of

go and shoot that man. and i asked myself: ought i not at least to go and
get the manuscript from that accursed place this instant? ought i not to
have taken it then and there? but see the utter misery of my situation, the
abject shame of it--suppose they were to take the thing! it is my one hope

paid no more attention to me than if i were a hound; but he had to send it
when they wrote! and perhaps they said something about carelessness and
that made him wild.

oh, the thing is an endless spring of gall to me! i am all raw with it--i
have to rush out on the street and walk away my passion. i never saw
my situation so plainly--the horrible impotence of it! just see what i

there are no words that can tell what an absolutely deadening thing it is
to be wandering about the city looking for work. it turns you into a log
of wood--you not only no longer have an idea, you have not a thought of an
idea. you simply drag on and on until the thing becomes a habit, and you go
without even thinking of that.

the day before yesterday, when i woke up in the morning, i could hardly
stand. my head was on fire, and i do not think i have ever been so sick
before. i got around to a drug-store--the man said he would give me some
powders; he said they were forty cents, but i dared not pay it. he gave
them to me for a quarter. he said i should have a tonic, but i haven't had

sick i could scarcely see--i did not care what she did. i told her that i
had no money; that i was waiting to get some work; that i would pay her the
first moment i could.

"why don't you keep work when you get it?" she demanded. "you have been
idle nearly all the whole time you've been here."

there in haste. i made fifty cents yesterday, for half a day, and a dollar
to-day. thank god!

i spent the night before last in the park, and last night in the room where
i am writing. it is in a tenement-house. i paid fifty cents a week for it,

answer advertisements meanwhile by mail, till i get something better.

the end


listen to me now. i must soon get to the end of this. i mean to tell you
about it. i have spent yesterday and to-day going over this journal,
explaining things that i had written too briefly, putting in things that
ought to be there. i mean to tell everything.

when i began this journal it was with the idea that i should be famous,
and that then it would be published. of late i have written it from habit,
mainly, never expecting that any one would see it. now i write again for a
reader, _to_ a reader. i know that it will be published.

       *       *       *       *       *

the night before last i went down by the river. as well as i can remember,
these were the thoughts that came to me.

       *       *       *       *       *

it was a calm, still night, and i sat watching the lights on the water.
then suddenly i recollected the night when the yacht had passed, and i had
heard the woman singing. it came back to me like an apparition, that voice
and that melody. i heard it again more plainly than words can tell, dying
away over the water; and a perfect sea of woe rolled over my soul.

i thought of that night, what i had been that night, what hopes i had had,
what fervor, what purpose, what faith. that was, you remember, just when i
was at the height of my work; and the memory came back to me, as it has
never come back to me since the day that i came out of the forest with my
book. it simply overwhelmed me, it shook me to the very depths of my being.
i buried my face and burst out sobbing. it shook away from me all the
hideous dulness that had mastered me. i saw myself as i was, ruined, lost.
i cried out: "oh, my father in heaven, it is gone! it is gone, and it will
never come back! i am a lost soul! i am a traitor, i am ruined!"

so i went on, feverishly, twisting my hands together. "i have given up the
fight! i have been beaten--oh, my god--beaten! think of those raging hours
in the woods, those hours of defiance, of glory! i gazed at commonplaceness
and dulness--i mocked at it; and now it has conquered me! i am trampled
down, beaten! it is all gone out of me!" and then i cried out in despair
and terror: "oh, no, it can't be! it _can't_ be!"

but even while i cried that, my thoughts fled back to the horror to which i
was tied, to the samples of soap and to the filthy hole next to a drunken
laborer. the thing overwhelmed me, even while i stood there trying to
resolve.

i was frenzied. "i have done everything," i panted, "i have fought and
toiled and struggled--i have wept and prayed, and even begged. and yet i
have been beaten--i have gone down--down! and what more is there that i can
do? i shall be beaten down again! oh, what shall i do? is there any hope,
any new plan that i can try? shall i go through the streets and shriek
it; shall i lay hold upon some man and _make_ him hear me? is there
anything--_anything_?"

to make them understand what i have! to make them understand what they are
doing! god gave me a vision--it may not come again for a century, it can
never come again--it is mine--_mine only_! and they grind it into the
dust! this demon power that is in me--don't you suppose i know what it is?
this thing that roars like the wind upon the mountains, that runs like the
great billows on the sea!

i was pacing back and forth in the silent night. i had all the world about
me, i cried out to it, i gripped it, to make it hear me. "fools! oh fools!"
i cried, "what is it that you _do_ believe in? blind creatures that
you are, this raging faith of mine--this fervent ardor--you do not believe
in _that_! you do not believe in enthusiasm, you do not believe in
ecstasy, you do not believe in genius! you think that i am mad, poor raving
poet! you see me sick, haggard, dragging myself about.

"but i am caged, i tell you,--i am caged! you are killing me as you would
kill some animal; and i am never to sing that song--i am never to sing that
song!"

the thing was a madness to me. "no, no!" i rushed on, "i will! i will get
free--i say i will! if i must, i will go out and beg on the streets, before
i will let this thing die! show me the vilest of you--i will get down upon
my knees before him--i will kiss his feet and beg him to let me live! there
is no degradation of my _self_ that i will not bear! i!--what am i?
i am a worm--i am filth--i am vanity and impertinence and delusion. but
_this_ thing--this is _god_! oh you man with a carriage, will
_you_ not give me a little? for a hundred or two of dollars i can live
for a year! and you--why, see that ring on your finger! you would not think
twice if you lost it; and yet think what i could do with that bauble! oh,
see how you abuse life--how you mock it, how you trample upon it--how you
trample upon _god_!

--"so i go about all day, haunted all the time, raging, lusting for my
task. and you who believe in genius in the past, and do not believe in it
in the present! some of you had this faith when you were young; but i have
it always--it is _i_! i was born for that, i will die for that! it is
my love, my food, my health, my breath, my life! it comes to me wherever
i am--carrying trays in a restaurant--pacing back and forth by the
river--sitting here in my room and writing of it!"

       *       *       *       *       *

so i thought, so i cried out; and each time as the thing surged in me, i
sank down and moaned and sobbed. "no, it is all lost. i am helpless. i am
beaten! i am walled in and tortured! i am a slave, i am a prisoner--i--"

--and so the torrent of my thoughts sped on, and so i rushed with
it--rushed to my fate. for suddenly i came to four words--four fearful
words that roared in my soul like the thunder!--

"i am a captive!"

it was like the falling of a bolt from the sky. it came with a sound that
stunned me, with a flash that lit in one instant the whole horizon of my
mind.

"i am a captive! i am _the_ captive! fool that i am,--pent here in
these prison-walls of tyranny, and beating out my brains against them!
panting--praying--cursing--pining to be free! and i am the captive!"

the thing struck terror into the last chambers of my soul. i stood stock
still; i felt my flesh quiver, i felt my very hair move. i saw a pair of
demon eyes glaring into mine--i saw all the wildness and the fearfulness
of life in that one instant.

"i wrote a book, i tried to make it true--and, oh, my god, how have i
succeeded!"

i do not know what i did, i was half-crazed, as in a nightmare. i fought
and struggled; but i was in the grip of a truth, and though it set my brain
on fire, i had to face it.

i was the captive! i was the captive! and i was crying out against
circumstances--i was crying out against my fate--and all the time there
it stood and faced me--the truth, the iron truth:

       *       *       *       *       *

--_i was to die!_

       *       *       *       *       *

a sudden fury swept over me--my whole being flamed with wrath. "what!" i
cried. "i shall go on in this servitude--in this degradation! i shall go
on playing the lackey to the filthy pleasures of men, cringing, crouching
before any insult--begging for my bread--begging to keep my miserable self
alive! and i shall see one by one my virtues die in me, my powers, my
consecrations! i shall sink into a beast of burden, into a clod of the
earth, into a tool of men!

"and i, who wrote the captive--my god, who wrote the captive! i, who stood
upon that height, drank in that glory, sang with those angels and gods! i,
who was noble and high-born--pure and undefiled--seer and believer--i! i
walked with truth--and now i am a slave; a whimpering, beaten hound! they
have made a eunuch of me, they have cut away my manhood! they have put me
with their swine, they have fed me upon husks, they have bid me drink their
swill! and i bear it, by god, i bear it! and why?--

"_i bear it that i may live!_"

       *       *       *       *       *

"come here, come here! look at this!" the thing seized me by the shoulders
and shook me, the thing with the fiery eyes. "did you _mean_ it, all
that you wrote in that book--did you mean it, those vows that you swore
in the forest? were they the truth of your soul as you faced your god--or
were they shams that you dallied with to please your vanity? answer me!
_answer_!"

       *       *       *       *       *

i sank down upon the ground as i heard that voice. i was shuddering with
fear; and i moaned aloud: "i don't want to die! i want to live, i want to
do my work!"--and then i heard the voice say, "you hound!"

and so i shut my hands like a vise; and i panted: "no, no! come! take me!
i will go!" i think it must have been hours that i lay there, wrestling in
horrible agony. i cried again and again: "yes, yes,--i will do it! i will
do it!" i fled on breathlessly, whispering, panting to myself. before i
knew it i was saying part of the captive--the first fearful lines of the
struggle:

  spirit or fiend that led me to this way!

oh, tell me, was ever poet so taken at his word before?

i thought of that then, and i shook like a leaf with the pain of it. again
and again i faced it, again and again i failed. it was physical pain, it
was a thing that i could feel like a clutch at my heart. was it not tearing
out my very soul?

       *       *       *       *       *

but the voice cried out to me: "you have been a slave to the world! you
have been a slave to life! you have been crucified upon the cross of
art!"--yes, and all things a man may sacrifice to art but one thing; he may
not sacrifice his soul!

"what!" it rushed on. "have you so much faith in your art, and no faith
in your god? is it for _him_ that you have so much need to fear, to
crouch and tremble, to plot and to plan--for _him_? and when he made
you, when he gave you your inspiration--his soul was faint?"

"he that sendeth forth the surging springtime, and covereth all the earth
with new life! he that is the storm upon the sea, the wind upon the
mountains, the sun upon the meadows! he that poureth the races from his
lap! he that made the ages, the suns and the systems throughout all
space--he that maketh them forever and smiteth them into dust again for
play! he that is infinite, unthinkable, all-glorious, all-sufficient--_he
hath need of thee_!

"he hath need that thy wonderful books should be written, that mankind
should hear thy wonderful songs! thy books, thy songs, that are to last
through the ages! and when this earth shall have withered, when the sun
shall have touched it with his fiery finger, when it shall roll through
space as silent and bare as the desert, when the comet shall have smitten
it and hurled it into dust, when the systems to which it belongs--the sun
into which it melted--shall be no more known to time--_where then will be
thy books and thy songs_? where then will be these things for which thou
didst crouch and tremble, didst plot and plan? for which thou didst lick
the feet of vile men--_for which thou didst give up thy god_!"

and then i leaped up and stretched out my arms. "no! no!" i cried aloud:
"i have done with it! have i not fought this fight once, and did i not win
it--this fight of the captive? and can i not fight it and win it again?
away, away with you, world, for i am a free man again, and no slave! soul
am i, _will_ am i, unconquerable, all-defying! in his arms i lie, in
his breath i breathe, in his life i live--i am _he_! fear i know not,
death i know not, slavery and sin and doubt and fear i will never know
again!"

nay,--nay. go thy road, proud world, and i go mine!--

oh, think not of that poetry! think of the music! the surging, drunken,
overwhelming waves of music! do you not hear them--do you not hear them?--

  wie sie schwellen,
    mich umrauschen!
  soll ich athmen,

so the thing went; and i panted and throbbed, and sank down upon the ground
for weakness. there came to me all that mad poetry that i had written
myself, all that victory that i had won, that freedom, that vision, that
glory! it came to me ten times over, for was it not everything to me now?
it was more than i could bear, it split my brain.

and it would not leave me. all through the long, long night i prayed and
wept with it; and in the morning i reeled through the street with it, and
men stared at me.

       *       *       *       *       *

but here was one time when i did not fear men! i was free--i was a soul at
last. i had won the victory, i went my way as a god. i had renounced, i had
given up fear, i had given up my _self_. my mind was made up, and i
never change my mind. i had passed the death-sentence upon myself, i walked
through the streets as a disembodied soul--as the captive dragged to the
banquet-hall.

but no, i went to my torture of myself.

       *       *       *       *       *

i went to the store. it was early sunday morning, and the place was just
open.--i got my papers and put them under my arm--my original draft of the
captive, and all my journal. i went down the street and came to a place
where a man was burning some trash.

i was a demon in my strength just then; my head reeled, but i went with the
dancing step of new-born things. i stood upon the heights, i "laughed at
all sorrow-play and sorrow-reality"! "ho, sir," i cried, "i have things
here that will make a fire for you!"

and so i knelt down and unwrapped the captive. "there is much fire in
this," i said; "once i thought it would explode, i did. it was a shot that
would have been heard around the world, sir! only i could not pull the
trigger."

the man stared at me, and so i burned it, page by page, and laughed, and
sang a foolish song that i thought of: _stride la vampa!_

and afterward i unwrapped the journal. i laughed at my journal--'tis a
foolish thing; but then all at once my conscience touched me. i said: "is
it not a shame? is it not small of you? they would not heed you!--fool,
what of it? perhaps it is not their fault--certainly it is their sorrow.
but you will not get much higher than you are now by trampling upon them."

and so i stopped; and i wrapped up my journal again. "you have fire enough
now, sir," i said to the man. "i will keep this to build another fire
with."

i went on. "let them have it," i said, "let them make what they can out of
it." and then i laughed aloud: "and they will discuss it! and there will be
reviews of it! and wise articles about it! and learned scholars will write
tomes upon it, showing how many sentences there are in it ending with a
punctuation mark; and old ladies and methodist ministers will shake their
heads over it and say: 'see what comes of not believing in adam!'"

i walked on, singing the ride of the valkyries, the children staring at me,
going to sunday-school.

i have thought a great deal about the thing, and it seems by no means best
for the world that it should treat all the men who have my gift as it has
treated me. let the world take notice that i perish because i have not
cheap qualities. because i was born to sing and to worship! because i have
no alloy, because i will not compromise, because i do not understand the
world, and do not serve its uses! if i only knew all the book-gossip of the
hour, and all the platitudes of the reviews! if only i knew anything of all
the infinite frivolity and puerility that occupies the minds of men! but
i do not, and so i am an outcast, and must work as a day laborer for my
bread.

--the infinite irrationality of it seems to me notable. why, upon the
men of genius of the _past_ you feed your lives, you blind and
foolish men! they are the bread and meat of your souls--they make your
civilizations--they mold your thoughts--they put into you all that little
life which you have. and your reviews have use enough for _them_! your
publishers publish enough of _them_! _but what thoughts have you
about the new teacher, the new inspirer?_

the madness of the thing! i read books enough, it seems to me, telling of
the sufferings of the poets of a century ago!--of the indifference of the
critics, the blindness of the public, of a century ago. and those things
pain you all so cruelly! but the possibility of their happening to the
poets of the _present_--it never seems to enter into your heads! why,
that very man who sent me back his curt refusal by his secretary--he writes
about the agonies of shelley and keats in a way that brings the tears into
your eyes! and that is only one example among thousands.

what do these men think? is it their idea that the public and the critics
are now so true and so eager that the poets have nothing more to fear? that
stupidity and blindness and indifference are quite entirely gone out of the
world? that aspiration and fervor are now so much the rule that the least
penny-a-liner can judge the new poet?

and they think that the soul is dead then! and that god has stopped sending
into this world new messages and new faiths!

oh you civilization! you society! you critics and lovers of books! why,
that new message and that new faith ought to be the one thing in all this
world that you bend your faculties to save! it is that upon which all your
life is built--it is that by which this republic, for one thing, is to be
made a factor in the history of mankind. but what do you do? what
_have_ you done? here i am; and come now and tell me what it is that
you _think_ you have done. _for i have the message!--i have the
faith_! and you have starved me, and you have beaten me, until i am too
ill to drag myself about!

and what can i do? where can i turn? what hope have i, except, as swift's
phrase has it, to "die like a poisoned rat in a hole"? i could wish that
you would think over that phrase a little while, cultivated ladies and
gentlemen. it is not pleasant--to die like a poisoned rat in a hole.

you ask me to believe in your civilization; you ask me to believe in your
love of light! let me tell you when i would believe in your civilization
and your love of light.

i say that the last and the highest thing in this world is _genius_.
i say that religion and art and progress and enlightenment--that all
these things are made out of genius; and that genius is first and last,
highest, and best, and fundamental. and i say that when you recognize that
fact--when you believe in genius--when you prepare the way for it and make
smooth the paths for it--i say that then and then alone may you tell me
that you are civilized.

the thing shrieks against heaven--your cruelty, your stupidity. since ever
the first poet came into this world it has been the same story of agony,
indignity, and shame. _and what do you do?_

it is poverty that i talk about, poverty alone! the poet wants nothing in
this world but to be let alone to listen to the voices of his soul. he
wants nothing from you in all this world but that you give him food while
he does it--while he does it, miserable people--not for himself, but for
_you_.

this is the shame upon you--that you expect--that you always have
expected--that the poet, besides doing the fearful task his inspiration
lays upon him--that he shall go out into the coarse, ruthless world and
slave for his bread! that is the shame! that is the indignity, that is
the brutality, the stupidity, the infamy! shame upon you, shame upon you,
world!

your louts--that he who will not work can not eat! your drones, and your

pay his way! no man must ask favors, no man must be helped, no man shall be

out! and now that i can not save my own self--oh, let me at least save the
others! o god, let me not die till i have said one word that reaches their
hearts, till i have done something to change this ghastly thing! the voices
of the ages cry out to me. not only the hundreds who have gone before--but
the hundreds and the thousands who are to come! what are _we_ to do?
they cry--who shall save _us_? are we to share the same fate--are we
too to struggle and die in vain? and in this world that is civilized! in
this world that seeks progress! in this world that wants nothing but light!
not to the mob i speak, not to those who once mocked me; if none but they
lived, i should hold my tongue and go. but you men who are leaders, you men
who stand upon the top, you men who see!--can i not find some word to reach
_you_? you men who really love books--who have money--who want nothing
but to put it to use!--can i not find some word to reach _you_?

i tell you this land will never be civilized, this land will never lead
mankind, it will never be anything but the torture-house that i have found
it, until it makes some provision for its men of _genius_! until this
simple fundamental thing be true--that a man may know that if he have
_genius_--that the day he shows he has _genius_--he will be
honored and protected by society and not trampled and kicked like a dog.
that he will not have to go out into the market-place and vend his wares!
that he will not have to make sick his soul haggling for his bread! that if
he turns his strength to higher things, and exposes himself to the world
thereby, he will not be trodden down in the struggle for existence! that
he will not have to bear indignities and insults; that he will not have to
write till he be ripe, or be stunted and deformed by early deprivation.

therefore let me write it: that i was a man of genius. and that you have
trodden me down in the struggle for existence. that i saw things that no
other man has ever seen, i would have written things that no other man
can ever write. and that you have trodden me down in the struggle for

this is what i tell you--this is what i cry out to you, that the man of
genius _can not_ earn his bread! that the work by which he develops
his power is something absolutely and utterly different from the work by
which he earns his bread! and that every hour which he gives to the one, he
lessens his power and his capacity for the other! every hour that he gives
to the earning of his bread, he takes from his soul, he weakens his work,
he destroys beauty which never again can he know or dream!

and this again is what i tell you, this again is what i cry out to you:
that the power by which a man of genius does his work, and the power by
which he earns his bread, are things so entirely distinct that _they may
not occur together at all_! the man may have both, but then again he may
only have the former.--and in that case he will die like a poisoned rat in
a hole.

what is the first principle of the democracy of which we boast, if
it be not that excellence, that power, that _genius_, is not the
attribute of the rich or the noble, but that it may make its appearance
anywhere among men? and you who sigh for men of talent to raise american
letters--what do you _do_ about it? i will tell you something right
now, to begin with; it will startle you, perhaps, and you may not believe
it; but i mean to prove it later on. for the present i say this: that of
the seven poets who constitute the glory of the literature of england in
the nineteenth century, four of them were rich men, five of them were
independent, one of them was endowed when he was a youth, and the seventh,
the greatest of them all, died like a poisoned rat in a hole.

and what do you _do_ about it? what you do is to lean back in your
chair and say: "the literary market was never so wide-awake as it is now,
and the publishers never so anxious for new talent"!

       *       *       *       *       *

fools! and you think that the publishers are in business for the developing
of talent, and for the glory of literature! and that they care about
whether a man of genius dies in the streets, or not! why, have i not heard
them tell me, with their own lips, that "a publisher who published books
that the trade did not want would be driven out of business in a year"?

       *       *       *       *       *

and you tell me that the author is an independent man nowadays! and can
earn his living with his books!

it is your privilege to think that, if you choose; but perhaps you will not
mind hearing what _i_ tell you--that the author can find no way to a
living more degrading to him than the earning of it with his books. i have
shoveled snow, and shoveled manure too, in the streets, and shoveled food
for swine in a restaurant. but i never did anything so degrading as i
should have had to do if i had tried to earn my living with my books.

       *       *       *       *       *

oh, the author may be independent, may he! and you will escape with that
fine platitude, and with that bitter mockery! and never think that the
author's independence is but the fine phrase for your own indifference!

again it is your privilege to think what you choose; but again perhaps you
will not mind hearing what i tell you--that there can never be any man
in this world more dependent than an author, if he be a true author. a
true author is the singer and dreamer of society; and who is there more
dependent than the singer and the dreamer--who is there less powerful and
less cunning in the things of the body?

       *       *       *       *       *

why, the author gives up his whole life for your joy and help, he
consecrates himself, he lashes and burns and tortures himself--for your
sake! and you spurn him from you, and tell him he is "independent"!

here is the truth, here is the crux, here is the whole thing in a sentence.
a publisher is not in business for the furtherance of art, or for the
uplifting of humanity, or for the worship of god. he doesn't mind doing
these things incidentally, of course, when the fortunate occasion arises;
but do you think if he had his choice between publishing a new paradise
lost to be read fifty years from date, and publishing a biography of a
reigning prince, or a treatise on gastronomy, or a new dime novel by marie
corelli in a first edition of a hundred thousand copies--do you think he
would hesitate, now really?

       *       *       *       *       *

you say that "literary excellence is identical with publishing
availability"! i tell you that they are as far apart--why, that they are
just exactly this far apart--as far as what mankind likes is from what
mankind ought to like.

       *       *       *       *       *

and you ask the man of genius to cringe and tremble before the standard
of what the reading public likes! you ask him to tame the frenzy of his
inspiration, to pull your pleasure-carriages with his winged steed! he
shall be no more the seer and the prophet and the leader--he shall be
mountebank and public-entertainer.

and you call yourself civilized! o god!

and the poet! again the poet! is he not _vital_ to your society? is
he not, in the last analysis, the lawmaker, the law-enforcer--this seeker,
this inspirer, this man with the new vision of right? i look at this
society--body enough i see, bone and muscle, and a good, large, capable
stomach. brain enough i see, too, or nearly enough; but soul? soul? who
will dare to tell me that there is soul enough? and your poet--why,
_he_ is your soul! he is the man who fills the millions with the
breath of life, who makes the whole vast machine a living, rejoicing,
beautiful thing. _he_--every noble impulse that you have has come
originally from him--the memory of his words thrill in the hearts
of men--pupils gather to study them--tired hearts seek them for
refreshment--they grow and they fill all the earth--and never through
the centuries do they die! they blossom into noble impulses, into new
movements,--into reforms that reach down to the lowest wretches of the
gutter, who never even heard of a poet. why, they have reached to the very
dogs, that are beaten less than they were.

believe that!--how are you going to _get_ the world to believe that?
is it--poor, impotent, foolish creatures--by covering your land until it is
a maze of twenty-story office buildings? by lining it with railroads six
feet apart?--do you not know that this very hour the reason why europe does
not believe in america is that it has not a man to sing its soul? that it

first of all it would mean that the man who felt in him the voice of god

was a home for him. he would no longer face the fearful alternative of
mediocrity or starvation. he would no longer be tempted, he would no longer
be forced to turn from his faith, and stunt his development, and wreck
his plans, by base attempts to compromise between his highest and what
the world will pay for. can you have any idea what that would mean to an
artist? you say that you love art! can you have any idea of the effect
which that would have upon art? upon the art of your country--upon american
literature! to have a band of perhaps a hundred--perhaps a thousand, proved
and chosen--the best and strongest that could be found--and set free and
consecrated to the search for beauty! try it for fifty years--try it for
ten years--try the method of raising your poets in your gardens instead of
flinging them into your weed-beds--and see what the result would be! see if
in fifty years american literature would not have done more than all the
rest of the world!

and what would it cost?--o god! is there a railroad in this country
so small that its earnings would not pay for it--for the whole of the
thousand? why, pay a poet five hundred dollars a year, and he is a rich
man; if he is not, he is no poet, but a knave.

       *       *       *       *       *

and there would be waste?--yes--where is there not waste? but grant that in
the whole thousand there is just _one_ who is a master mind; and that
him you set free and keep from defeat--that him with all his glory you make
yours--and then tell me if there be any other way in this world that you
could have done so much for man with your money!

--no, these are not your ways, oh you cruel world! you let every man go his
way--you let him starve, you let him die in any hole that he can find. the
poet--tenderest and most sensitive of all men! the poet--the master of the
arts of suffering! exposed on every side, nervous, haunted, unused to the
world, knowing how to feel and knowing that alone! is not his life an agony
under any conditions,--is he not tortured for you--the world? and you leave
him helpless, despairing!

what is the matter with you?--how can you be so blind? there are some of
you who really love books--look and see the story of genius--if it be not
a thing to make you shudder and turn sick. it has been so through all the
ages, and it will be so through all the ages to come, until society has
a conscience and a soul. tell me if there is anything in this world more
frightful than the lot of the poets who have been born poor--of marlowe and
chatterton and goldsmith, johnson and burns and keats! and who can tell how
many were choked before even their first utterance?

great stalwart ones were rich? to be educated, to own books, to hear music,

wordsworth came first; he was young and poor and struggling, and a friend
left him just such an independence as i have cried for; and he consecrated
himself to art, and he revolutionized english poetry, he breathed truth
into a whole nation again. and when he was clear and looked back, he made
such statements as these: that "a poet has to _create_ the taste by
which he is to be enjoyed," and that "my poetry has never brought me enough
to pay for my shoe-strings."

his poems do not date from then. when he wrote the poetry that has been the
spiritual food of the high souls of this century, he lived in a beautiful
villa in italy, and wandered about the forest with his books. and oh, you
who love books, stop just a moment and listen: i am dying, and the cry
of all my soul is in this. tell me, you who love shelley--the "pardlike
spirit, beautiful and swift"--"thyself the wild west wind, oh boy
divine!"--tell me how much you think you'd have had of that glorious burst
of music--that golden rain of melody, of heavenly ecstasy--if the man who
wrote had been a wholesale-paper clerk or a cable-car conductor! how much
do you think you'd have had if when he'd torn himself free to write queen
mab--or even if he'd been ripe enough and written his prometheus--if he'd
had to take them to publishers! if he had had to take them to the critics
and the literary world and say, "here is my work, now set me free that i

of islam--he was my age then; but i will go ten years later and take
prometheus bound. would he have found any one to publish it? _did_ he
find any one to _read_ it? why, ten or twenty years after shelley
died, browning (then a boy) records that he searched all england for a
copy of that queer poet's works! why, shelley's poetry was a byword and a
mockery; and shelley himself--first of all he was insane, of course, and
afterward he was exile, atheist, adulterer, and scoundrel. they took his
children away from him, because he was not fit to take care of them!

nervous, fragile, hysterical boy--do you think he would ever have written
his poems, that he would ever have uttered his message?

i have to make somebody understand this thing, somehow. i suggest that you
think what that would have meant to you--to you who love poetry. think that
you would never have read:

  oh wild west wind, thou breath of autumn's being!...
  oh lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud,

i repeat that i have to make somebody understand this thing. i try that
plan a little more. listen to me now--think what it would have meant if
that wise friend had not died when he did; think that you would never have

think that you would never have read:

inspiration of whole peoples, the sources of multitudes of noble deeds and

them this day? how many young men and maidens are going out into the world

mean on a wagner night! here is the inspiration of a sainted poet, here is
ecstasy unthinkable, flung wide and glorious as the dawn; and here is all
